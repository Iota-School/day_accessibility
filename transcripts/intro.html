Welcome to the "Day of

Accessibility" at Space

Telescope Science Institute. My

name is Mark postman.

it's a pleasure to welcome you

to this meeting today.

We want to enable the world to

share in the wonder of space

telescopes, either orbiting the

earth or the sun as we speak --

last time I checked.

The Hubble space telescope and

the James Webb space telescope

are the two that are currently

operational and in the 2026 time

frame, the Nancy Grace Roman

telescope will be another

amazing addition to the flagship

fleet we have up there.

Of course, in the mid-future

range, what will we be doing?

We are thinking about yet

another amazing space telescope,

allowing us to potentially find

evidence for life on planets

around other stars.

That's an amazing future to look

forward to.

I hinted at one of them already,

the flagship missions, the other

three are equally important,

advanced state of the art

astronomical research and tools

for scientific discovery, make

the world's astronomical

information accessible to all

and promote an inclusive,

equitable workplace and

cultivate a diverse, engaged

workforce.

I believe great ideas and

innovations about how to achieve

those great ideas are not

limited by where you are, who

you are, what your physical

capabilities are, great ideas

exist everywhere.

The more people we can include

in achieving those goals, the

better we will be in the better

we will find things we could

have imagined yesterday or

today.

With that, I'm very excited to

hear how we are going to make

sure that what we do here in

terms of software, notebooks,

other types of tools to explore

the universe are made accessible

for all. With that, I welcome

you to this meeting.

I'm going to turn it over to

Jen.

Thank you.

</p>



<p> Jennifer: Hi, everyone.

I am so, so excited to welcome

you today.

Let me pull up the other slide.

Okay.

Welcome to the "Day of

Accessibility" here at Space

Telescope Science Institute, my

name is Jennifer Kotler and I

work here as a user experience

designer.

The last few years, I've been

immersing myself in

accessibility and science and

design.

This is my coorganizer, Patrick

Smyth.

</p><p> Patrick: Hi, I am Patrick, I

am a blind coder, teacher, and

writer, and chief learner at the

Iota School.

</p><p> Jennifer: We have people that

designed and used various

adaptable technologies, we have

scientists, technologists,

writers, designers, both local

and federal, librarians,

accessibility advocates and a

bunch of students.

In fact, later, we will have a

whole cohort of students.

Some of you are students here in

Baltimore and others are

streaming in from online. Even

internationally.

For those in person, a few quick

notes about the facilities, feel

free to move between the lobby,

auditorium, bathrooms, cafe,

there's a patio back there as

well.

All the other areas in the

building will require card

access.

They are only for STScI

employees.

If you have an accessibility

concern or any questions, please

feel free to ask me or Patrick

or anyone wearing a badge

colored in with a yellow

highlighter.

Ask anyone for help.

We will all help each other out.

A couple of notes for those

online, a link to the closed

captioning has been posted in

the chat so you can open that up

in a browser to follow along.

There are links to the schedule

for today and to the slides for

the talks at that schedule.

This, today, has been organized

by a project called Notebooks

for All.

We have a link to the web site.

It's in the slides.

Okay.

I will quickly go over the

schedule.

We are going to start a talk by

Notebooks for All in a couple

minutes and have a 15-minute

break.

Then we will have a talk about

accessible text descriptions,

alt text and James Webb images,

we will have another break then

the keynote by Josh Miele, we

will have lunch in the cafe.

We will have a lot of touchable

graphics.

We will an astronomy data

saponification talk, we will

learn how to use a screen

reader, close with being an

advocate and be along our way,

back into our lives.

Jupyter Notebooks are a

foundational tool for astronomy,

data science, and many other

STEM fields but they are

currently not accessible to

screen readers and other

assistive technology, Tony and

Isabela are going to give a

background on that and share

more about the project,

addressing that problem.

Please give a warm welcome to

Isabela and Tony coming all the

way from the West Coast.

Thank you.

[Applause]
