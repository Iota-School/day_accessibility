    <p>
      So we are getting to the

      interactive portion of the

      event.

      So, Patrick Smith, who

      introduced himself earlier, I'm

      really excited for this part by

      the way -- here so let me -- oh,

      yes.

      And for the AV, if he could

      bring some the iPads down.

    </p><p> Please also bring one for me.

    </p><p> So, Patrick Smith, he is a

      chief lower in her Iowa school,

      and he teaches tech, and he

      specialize in Texas testability

      so he does this screenreader

      workshop and I know for a lot of

      people they do screen readers

      all the time you are all

      preferred or sighted people, it

      is often really difficult to

      learn how to use a screen I

      personally struggle to try and

      learn so Patrick is going to try

      and teach us in few minutes.

      And so, to start, I will handed

      over to him, but if you have an

      iOS device, give Betty we have

      some additional ones if you do

      not have one.

      But here I go I will hand it

      over to him.

    </p><p> Presenter: Thank you so much

      Jen.

      And I'm not successful as

      Josh -- I don't have any slides

      but I have a resource.

      So if you want to try and access

      this web page, or if you are

      following along online,

      hopefully they can put a link to

      the resource in the chat as

      well.

      But you can go to the Iota

      School.com and it's on the front

      page if you scroll down.

      But, we're going to grab some of

      these iPads and such, and

      hopefully a certain number of

      you have iOS devices but today

      we're going to learn to use this

      screenreader.

      In a do you know what it's very

      cool but it's the first time I

      run this workshop are working to

      a significant number of blind

      people in the audience which is

      good.

      You can tell me what's thinks

      about this and how I can work it

      out. But I hope it's a little

      bit validating to have people

      around you learn a thing or two

      about screenreader, it's a weird

      private experience when you are

      a print disabled person a user

      screenreader you have all your

      devices talk to you all the time

      they are using your phone and

      the reality that's awesome

      differ from the people around

      you it could be alienating so

      let me know if you find it a

      little bit validating to have

      people around you also have

      robots talking into the ears.

      And so, we will start with how

      this is towards the end of the

      day.

      So I made Scott was pretty

      hands-on and interactive and fun

      as well.

      So we Saint interactive stuff of

      the afternoon when you're

      probably sliding a little bit.

      We're going to be, for most of

      the structure going to be doing

      stuff.

      And -- the website will be

      connected to you whether your

      own implicit website or your

      organization website or are, and

      app that you frequently use an

      iOS they are interested in.

      And so, honestly, I'm going to

      get into some caveats and so on.

      But let's get into what is a

      screenreader and I will lay some

      caveats improvisers and so on

      there.

      I also just want to say that I

      can talk fast.

      I can try and slow down a little

      bit.

      But can people hear me okay?

    </p><p> Okay I sound better now.

      I do sound a lot better now.

      [Laughter]

      All right okay.

      So what is a screenreader?

      First of all I'd like to say

      when I'm not talking about

      accessibility I am often talking

      about or teaching about people

      and how to use technology.

      Him teach Stater College in city

      of New York.

      In college and, it is something

      I introduce people to that I

      really enjoyed bringing people

      into the New World.

      It is a little different but are

      making an analogy.

      So, it is that you all use your

      computer every day.

      Use your web browser, you use

      your mail apps, your social

      media apps on your phone, all of

      the stuff.

      You use it probably am guessing

      that she may not be true for

      everyone but he use it to a user

      interface.

      It basically means that the

      computer usage old delay that

      draws a lot of boxes and windows

      up and buttons.

      And also to things on your

      screen.

      But you know, I'm going to

      pretend now, without talk about

      it for a minute but will say

      visually, but, what was actually

      the case and there's a whole

      other -- that's only the iceberg

      of the world of software.

      And, one thing I teach my

      students is the command line or

      the terminal where there's a lot

      of other words for it.

      But it's essentially a whole

      other world lurking beneath the

      surface.

      Another way to interact with

      your computer and it does look

      like were Hock east Tan 80

      movies or whatever.

      But it is also how more than

      half of our software is written

      for that.

      Most of because it is often what

      programs and use and they

      laughed him right just enough

      for them to use not something.

      And they will write a the

      graphical parts.

      So there's a lot of software out

      there that you can use if you

      graphical user interface. So

      similarly, and I'm also very

      excited to introduce you which

      is a world of the screenreader.

      In similar to the terminal which

      is lurking beneath the surface

      is the screenreader is a

      completely different way of

      interacting with your computer.

      Essentially, or your phone, but

      that's also computer.

      So, a screenreader is

      essentially a program that runs

      a note allows you to interact

      with your operating systems and

      all its intended applications

      and functionality.

      Nonvisually.

      And I don't say that this is

      necessarily through audio

      because they are different

      modalities that you can

      experience a screenreader

      through.

      In the main tool being either

      listening to audio, so in

      listening to synthesized speech

      or, listening to braille

      displayed.

      And a braille display is

      typically delivered through a

      refresh of a braille display

      which is very expensive devices.

      There are often many thousands

      of dollars in the rival cars and

      their expenses often and it can

      be easily $60,000 anything like

      that.

      There are much cheaper ones but

      that is another way that

      commuters can share information

      with their users. The current

      ecosystem of screen readers is

      one were going to be using today

      and its voice-over on iOS. Which

      is pretty different piece of

      screen readers.

      This also voice-over on my

      computers which is the main

      screen readers that is used on

      Mack or a desktop or laptop

      devices.

      It is also called voice-over.

      It's a pretty different beats

      and is not really use very

      similarly.

      You have to learn a different

      thing for that. So were going to

      be learning -- and I would argue

      this is the most intuitive then

      going in the first few hours or

      minutes or hours of using him.

      However, there is also the

      android answer to a voice-over

      or talkback.

      I will say does not have the

      same uptake in the community.

      People can speak up if they are

      disagree or their vocal android

      users or something.

      My experience voice-over seems

      to work a lot more for visually

      impaired folks are blind people.

      Also, I will say on desktop or

      Windows are probably more

      popular, for blind people, and

      they are divided into draws

      which is a proprietary and

      somewhat expensive screenreader

      job access was just what it

      stands for.

      And there's also the only VDA,

      my personal favorite which is

      more of a scrappy open source

      and -- actually line developed

      which is very close to Australia

      by fellows created that in the

      mid-2000s.

      And I'm very glad they did.

      It's very habitable in a talk

      that up a little bit more but

      that's probably one of the one

      they really open standard right

      now.

      And then, in addition, there

      is -- it's not the best one I'm

      sorry, Emma Grande exist, but

      it's orca, it's orca for landing

      cinnamon feel like I'm missing

      that but on a chrome book you

      can use chrome box, which is

      action not terrible, and you can

      use it on Google Chrome with so

      little difficulty.

      If you run a Lennix or something

      like that it's actually not the

      words it's hard to get it

      working but is not actually

      about screenreader. And so,

      let's go to the next one which I

      believe is -- this is the

      caveats.

      Okay.

      So, one distinction is very

      important with the screenreader

      when you're entering the world

      of screen readers and you also

      are thinking about this world of

      analyzing things for

      accessibility or building

      assessable things.

      There are sodas two ways this is

      conveying information.

      It's a little bit of a difficult

      distinction to get it, and I'm

      sorry you know lot of

      accessibility folks who say I

      know this very well but

      hopefully I'm not trying to --

      but hopefully this distinction

      between visual conveyance of

      information and semantic

      information.

      Semantic is a really fancy word

      but basically it means

      meaningful.

      It means sharing meaning.

      And in the world of apps and the

      world of websites and HTML.

      There are structures, the

      computer will either know what a

      particular structure is or

      object is or interfaces or will

      not.

      And I'll give an example and

      explain it more.

      If this is one of my classes

      this is when I pop something

      open and create a very simple

      website or something but were

      not live right now.

      But, imagine, and I'm sorry that

      many of you may not be super

      familiar with it but behind the

      scenes -- and actually can you

      press the Max Burton you?

      Can you hit that?

      This is dangerous but it works.

      Thank you.

      Here are some scary looking

      stuff but don't get too stressed

      out.

      But basically this is what you

      are dealing with when you are

      under the covers whenever you're

      putting up a website.

      It's basically trying to explain

      what we are seeing here it is

      HTML which is -- it's basically

      a structural tree form.

      So it's a nested structure.

      Things within things.

      First there will be two elements

      are two attacks that create an

      element that is all the and

      eight you man well.

      and then there's another one

      that is the body of the text.

      And within that you can have

      also to have different

      structures.

      If you have a heading, you will

      have a start and end with the

      heading tag if each one.

      Conveying, inside that you will

      put the text of the heading and,

      the reason we do this is because

      the way the HTML is conceived,

      the markup language it is

      basically a way of describing

      documents.

      And, what we mean is what we

      discover the document's that

      were telling the computer how

      the different elements are for

      it.

      So we say this is a heading. We

      see this is a paragraph.

      This is a list.

      This is a link.

      This is a button.

      These are things we explained to

      the computer and we do that so

      the computer knows how to build

      that and how to use Isaiah.

      Unfortunately, and they are

      overgrazed to build websites

      that will convey information

      visually but will the be

      semantic.

      Essentially the computer will

      have no idea what you're

      intending to do.

      And so, the example could be

      that you can unintimidate them

      now if you would like. Please

      bring it back.

      So, say you are creating a

      banana website. The semantic way

      to do it is you open a time, and

      you say angle bracket is not a

      word the people say, but angle

      bracket button and close angle

      bracket and you make attack of

      buttons he put some information

      about the button they enclosed

      the tag and you bracket/button.

      And -- but you basically create

      a button by saying button. This

      is a button computer.

      However, it is very easy to make

      a button by using somatic tax.

      And you can make it look

      identical to a button that is

      actually properly described to

      the computer.

      In two nondisabled use.

      Driving the things around with

      the mouse and doing things for a

      quote unquote conventional way

      they will encounter the button

      the same way the semantic

      button.

      However, if you screenreader

      user will rely on the

      distinction that that structure

      is actually being described

      properly.

      So, I will say that distinction

      underlies not everything, but a

      very large percent of issues

      with accessibility.

      Is that people implementing

      information and visual

      information without conveying

      the semantic element that will

      allow Alex Quevedo to do the

      job.

      So if you are understanding

      that, and then extended the idea

      of semantics and semantic

      elements and making things

      semantic and meaningful or

      explaining things to the

      computer they you're going to

      make much more accessible

      things.

      So, let us talk about -- were

      going to transition towards this

      practical part so get excited

      because were about to be doing

      things pretty soon.

      But I wanted to these caveats

      and provided.

      Yeah working of words. But

      basically I want to say actually

      for things.

      I know I'll he said three but

      this actually one more thing I

      want to say.

      That is first, the point of this

      exercise is not so you have

      empathy for blind people so you

      feel blessed for us blind

      people.

      It would feel a little like that

      because for you it'll be a

      little foot difficult to use

      this.

      I'm speaking now to having use

      it before.

      And maybe feel a little

      difficult and awkward to use a

      screenreader and that is normal.

      Especially if you are learning a

      new thing.

      However, most people use this

      every day and have been using

      them for a long time in we're

      pretty fast with them in good

      with them.

      Not in all cases, but often.

      So your experience of trying it

      for the first time will not

      necessarily be as smooth because

      it should never be smooth.

      But it will not be as -- the

      facility comes with experience

      they experience will not

      necessarily be the expense of a

      blind person using the

      screenreader.

      Because a blind people have been

      using it for longer.

      So I just want to say that but

      the purpose of the exercise is

      to actually get a little taste

      of it.

      But do not worry about us it's

      good that we have screen

      readers.

      They are going to have.

      At the same time, on the flip

      side, don't assume that just

      because screen readers exist

      that blind people can

      necessarily do everything.

      I'm not saying that blind

      people -- I should say disabled

      because people with different

      disabilities or dyslexia and

      other disabilities or mental

      ability they also use screen

      readers so I'm sorry, I'm being

      a little colloquial there, but

      there's a lot of screen readers

      using it as well.

      But, unfortunately, is facing

      seen today, then everything is

      made to be assessable.

      And that's a little bit of an

      understatement but, a lot is

      assessable and things have

      gotten better and things will

      hopefully continue to get

      better.

      But, do not think that just

      because they exist they are not

      then be able to do everything.

      Because the screenreader we are

      is kind of relying on things

      having to be properly

      implemented.

      In the we have assessable

      facilities with the act.

      whatever were trying to use.

      In iOS. One might think, I

      related to this now, but it's

      not just blind people, if you

      are saying -- if any of you

      using the screenreader, don't

      assume that everyone using the

      screenreader will move on.

      It's simply not the case.

      Also, do not assume everyone is

      using screenreader because even

      blind people have different

      outer range of vision.

      I have about 2% vision.

      So I have peripheral vision

      which is useful at times to have

      but it's some things that I

      can't do link can do and that's

      true of a lot of blind people so

      do not make assumptions about

      people seeing things and not

      seeing things.

      Or just because the screenreader

      is on they might when use

      assessable visible they want to

      use iPhoto and ethics.

      So don't assume it will be

      nonvisible.

      In this one other thing I want

      to add that's not on here and

      I'll add it after this and this

      is been inspired by a

      conversation between Josh Miele

      intending that yesterday, and

      Tony said which my experience --

      my experience was that when you

      turn on the screenreader it

      talks to you so much it can be

      overwhelming. It's essentially

      an overload right.

      And Josh said which I agree with

      is the first thing you teach

      people when the screenreader

      areas is that you get her to

      talk.

      The second thing you do is he

      trying to teach them to shut it

      out.

      So would do that right after we

      teach her to. I will teach you

      the magic gamble teach you to be

      slanted so that's an important

      part of it.

      Hayek, solicited into it.

      We will get these iPads down

      here.

    </p><p> Who doesn't have an iOS

      device?

    </p><p> You want to do the neat thing

      that Josh Day?

      Say you need one is more

      important but I'm curious.

      And I have one as well.

      My phone is pretty out of date

      to.

      This is like an iPad to many.

      All right, so we have

      activated -- and I want to show

      you a couple different ways of

      getting this to going.

      Were going to have a pretty wide

      away of devices they'll tell you

      a couple of different ways of

      getting component to point B and

      hopefully one of them will work

      for you.

      If not let us know who will come

      around to help out okay?

      Also we have plenty people in

      this room and, hopefully they

      can also help.

      They are experts at please just

      tuck them in the shoulder and

      tell them what they have to say

      to get this thing going okay?

      So, you put it in some salt

      water. Take her to stop talking.

      All right so, hopefully you have

      had Iowa's device in your hand

      is that a reasonable assumption?

      Should I give them a second?

      Okay.

      So there are two basic types of

      eye gizmos that we will have to

      deal with.

      Number one, they have the home

      button.

      These older devices they also

      have iOS devices that are like

      that whatever number CA's, and

      the cheaper one than they also

      have the home button.

      I personally like having a home

      button but they are the older

      ones that they try get rid of.

      So, what were basically going to

      try and do is talk to these

      people straightforward, and then

      we'll show you another way in

      case he doesn't you.

      Not everyone is able to speak to

      Siri because I have a dad who is

      from Monahan and Siri just him.

      [Laughter]

      And that's in Ireland.

      We will try to talk to Siri. In

      a minute teach you to show you

      two different ways to get to the

      iOS devices that have Siri come

      up in one evening trying to say

      when you have her attention and

      yes this will be cares because

      everyone can be doing at the

      same time but that's fine part

      of the exercise okay trying away

      he has out.

      We need to get a hold on the

      home button okay, if you have

      one now Larry Shyatt ability to

      it and then, if you do not have

      the home button you in a hold on

      the lock button does make it the

      attention.

      So I started on this and have

      read or work space it started

      and it didn't make sense to

      first.

      He if found great.

      Okay turn on voice-over.

      Good.

      Thank you.

      All right, so I just said, I

      held down the home button which

      is a bottom in the button in the

      middle of the device. In the

      bottom.

      And go ahead, this can be a

      noisy session but I held down

      the home button which is in the

      middle, and then I said, what I

      had to raise attention, which I

      kind of like when it makes his

      sun didn't make a sound but I

      did get his.

      Then I said turn on voice-over.

      Then I waited here in that tone

      and said something so I was

      really good. So the default for

      service for Samantha.

      So that's the one I use.

      So, we have voice-over on, maybe

      for some people.

      So I'm going to show you another

      way know what I want for that he

      can't because I want everyone to

      get there and then a muscle

      cliche in a long way to okay?

      Because you can't get it to work

      there are other ways to get it

      to work.

      So if you don't have the little

      home button and just hold on the

      lock button and many devices

      this on the top right.

      Sometimes that's the only button

      on those newer devices.

      So hold down the button and say

      turn on voice-over.

      RA, the long way to do it is I

      have to turn on -- I'm not

      hearing mine so I have to turn

      the volume.

      Hang on a saying I need to get

      my thing going here.

      Ahead of fell into the brown

      rank because only two hands.

      Thank you.

    </p><p> Turn on voice-over.

      Okay, can you hear me?

      My still broadcasting?

      Okay.

      So, one thing I have not told

      you, because if the first time

      we turn our voice-over gives you

      a warning, saying flows over may

      need to use a computer whatever,

      you want to do, is that in that

      case Kat Timpf to Britain you

      want to activate which is cancel

      or accept.

      Talk except, if it works fine if

      it doesn't work for him but you

      may need to tap at once and then

      wait a second then double tap it

      again. It's old marketing.

      I will talk about why you have

      to do that.

      Leonard Senator Cochran's work

      comes up with the Michael Earley

      boy.

      so I wanted to and first.

      and then within a home around

      and make sure that they have the

      device is turned on voice-over

      K?

      And so to get it to say

      something just touch anywhere on

      the screen.

      And I'm wrapped up in this.

      So, I tapped randomly on the

      screen in the of the left and he

      said clock.

      Ness that he to stop talking say

      you're talking talking talking

      he becomes overwhelmed.

      I'm a top that same area and he

      should say something like lock

      account and then went to take my

      two fingers adjuster, and get a

      tick two fingers in that it

      would teleports of the

      screwdriver, so great a tap on

      the clock I use two fingers.

    </p><p> So I'm tapping and I'm

      silencing it by tapping twice of

      my two fingers.

      I tapped once with my two

      fingers. So make the piece

      finger signed as two fingers

      holding up, and I tapped.

      If you top again you got a great

      amount of sound coming out of

      there. I don't know you have

      trained sounds coming up of U.S.

      but I like it.

      So if you wanted to resume

      speech you can tap once more.

      So I will try another.

      So, one might think I'm I'm

      gonna make it speak the whole

      freight screen.

      With a 52 fingers musket pistes

      crying and goodness wipe down

      where.

      And is can I speak everything

      from where I am now.

      So one where I last tapped on

      the screen to start speaking and

      keep going.

      Nice. Maybe that's part of the

      workshop. But yes.

      Because it took something like

      the magic type.

      And it's actually look really

      cool piece of functionality.

      But if you make a peace sign EF2

      finger sticking up, and you tap

      twice is very easy, I told you

      do only do it once, but if you

      do it twice, and you activate

      the magic type. And that is a

      contextual command.

      And typically what it does is

      that it plays your media.

      So if you have an audiobook, but

      we have music, it will play.

      I don't know, I'll try on this

      but I doubt anything will play

      but let's give it a try anyway.

      So this one is no Savior but it

      doesn't have anything.

      But in other contexts, if

      someone calls you in using

      voice-over units will cause you,

      the phones ringing, need to get

      to fingers, your piece findings

      have twice that magic tab

      contextually lies in the phone.

      So the magic type is a way to do

      things quickly using voice-over

      to space and context.

      It will do other things in other

      contexts.

      The thing you may need is play

      your media. So thank you Josh.

      RA, so, I do want to come around

      initiative teams people have

      things activated. Though I like

      to do the for you all to do now

      this is your assignment while

      the Koran to things activated is

      I want you to explore your home

      screen okay?

      You can go to Joe's for an

      improper home button and if you

      have another screen you do not

      have a home button, -- use or

      you don't have an iPad, you may

      just be stuck on the screen

      currently on this fine for now.

      Just take your finger, one

      fingered only about the peace

      sign, take it one finger and

      explore the screen okay.

      So just move your finger around

      the screen and explore end of

      basic modalities, as you move

      your finger over the screen you

      will discover things on the

      screen.

      So we will reach out to you

      items that you are currently

      touching okay?

      And as a disabled user, that is

      useful because you explain this

      in finding outlets on the

      screen.

      But I haven't cover yet is how

      to activate items and he and the

      activate science and some like

      doing it which is God. but we'll

      get there and embedded in that

      point but for now worry about

      explain the screen in no way

      about activating Hayden's would

      do it shortly but I will check

      on people.

      So that is your assignment and I

      will be right back.

      Take minutes or so and I'll be

      right back in an end make sure

      they have it.

      Let's have a niece is anything?

    </p><p> Calling okay thank you.

    </p><p> All right at the hearing me?

      Okay. All right.

      So if you are you I see some of

      you have activated that and that

      is great.

      So, you've explored the screen,

      now what I want to show you is

      how to activate an item.

      So, do homework right now if you

      have the weather app on your

      home screen you want to find the

      weather app by navigating around

      with your finger so when it

      selected I wonder if I have a

      here?

      I'm turning it up to the max and

      then front of myself.

      [phone is making noise]

    </p><p> So there is the calendar so

      we can do that.

    </p><p> I thought weather would be on

      here but let's just do the

      calendar instead.

      So say you want to activate the

      calendar okay so what you would

      like to do is select the

      calendar and then my case this

      on the top right but yours may

      vary. And then when it is

      selected after you touch on it

      once and take your finger and

      tap tap twice really fast in

      succession okay? So tap

      twice... Then you hear a click

      tick and then it will open the

      app and usually when the app

      opens it it will announce the

      name of the absolute will say

      calendar or whatever so you know

      that's right or wrong.

      And that's how you activate

      those items.

      On the calendar up specifically

      this is asking me probably

      whatever -- this is Apple

      bothering me -- sure, why not

      calendar.

      Allow while using app.

      So I clicked on Allawi using

      app.

      And then, I'm going to double

      time to activate the items I can

      use the calendar.

      Now, I wanted to teach you what

      what my gesture and then I'm

      gonna cut you loose on one of

      the websites okay. So we did the

      peace sign holding two fingers

      up, now we're going to do three

      fingers.

      I don't have a cool name for it

      but, it's holding up three

      fingers now.

      In a bit of your hand probably

      could be any three fingers

      obviously but I think technique

      set-asides -- he can use any

      three fingers. Take your three

      fingers and then either swipe up

      or down and I will scroll the

      fall which is actually one of

      the main things we do in these

      devices it's important factor.

      So make sure they are selecting

      the area they want to scroll. So

      tap on the bed on the screen so

      far so that you there's April

      16th, let me take my three

      fingers, and I'm going to swipe

      up from the bottom of the device

      to the top.

      And now it's going down the

      page.

      So, you have a screeching sound

      that sketching down the page.

      And that is the bottom.

      And I can go up or down.

      Okay?

      And, from in the calendar app I

      can swipe left to right with

      three fingers in a bring me to

      different days.

      So here is Thursday to Friday.

      And now it's a Saturday.

      All right. And so, what I would

      like for you all to do now is

      take a few minutes and I would

      like you too, it may be a

      challenge, but, try to pull up

      the website for your

      organization or your personal

      website or some other website

      that you use every day.

      Okay? It would gonna do an end

      accessibility evaluation.

      So now open Safari finding on

      your home screen, press the home

      button, and Safari is using the

      dog which is the part in the

      bottom of the screen.

      Find Safari, and we haven't

      shown you this, because I'm

      assuming most of you are

      navigating visually, but you may

      not be.

      You can also swipe with one

      finger left or right to move

      sequentially through the

      different items.

      So for messages to Safari to

      music and mail.

      So, open Safari you want to try

      to find your website.

      I will involve using the

      keyboard.

      You may want to turn voice

      overall for the time being above

      the left side.

      But if you want to challenge,

      you can try using the voice over

      keyboard.

      Which will involve typing on a

      ladder and then double tap into

      activated in the default mode

      okay?

      You may want to turn off

      voice-over it's find your

      website and then turn it back

      on.

      Is it cheating?

      Yes, but typing is really

      counting when you first thing.

      And I will come around the room

      and check on people. And then

      trying to -- trying to think

      about whether or not they say

      anything surprise you at this --

      please be quiet, trying to ink

      about whether or not anything

      surprises you about the site.

      And ask yourself one of the

      easiest things to evaluate it

      all the elements and if they are

      labeled. When your finger over

      his many elements as possible

      and listen to what they are.

      And if it surprises you.

      Especially things like buttons

      and with images.

      Either they were correctly

      weather.

      But who made the website but

      this is a button?

      Or, 1927-1925 that HP's Eagle

      whatever -- but yet here we go I

      will be coming around.

      And can we pull up that cage

      will wear during accessibility

      evaluation.

      Yes.

      So they can have it right in

      front of them. Yes.

      Thank you.

      Fantastic.

      Yes please wander around that'll

      be helpful thank you. Forever

      going to need like ten more.

    </p><p> Okay so some people have

      unlocked the secret feature.

      And that is screen curtain which

      is basically a feature that

      makes it so that the screen does

      appear to be off.

      But the phone is not off the

      monkey he sees voice-over, the

      idea behind that if you are

      blind, you do not need the

      screen to be on racing battery

      over time.

      You don't need people looking

      over your shoulder seeing what

      you're doing.

      So, to turn that feature on or

      off I will say don't worry about

      a breaking trade you want.

      But it is three fingers and they

      went out three times.

      Okay?

      And I will turn off the screen

      and now you only with

      interactive would be voice-over.

      Okay so be gentle.

      and the speech is off exactly.

      That's another thing.

      If your voice-over starts

      talking to you but it's the kind

      of thinking noises and move

      around the screen and you

      clearly so long because whatever

      the interactions are different

      than you want to hold down or

      take ticket freethinkers attempt

      twice and I would tend speech by

      Connor Tate? Yes a lot to learn.

      All right, we'll go to due to my

      minutes and then I want to see

      if anyone succeeded in finding a

      website and navigating around.

      I know it's a short amount of

      time that's why we have will be.

    </p><p> This is just music to my

      ears.

      In this place is Samantha. The

      best default voice. And this

      probably Russian attacks made of

      mustard cement.

      All right, so that anyone

      managed to -- I will come around

      with the Mike, did anyone manage

      to pull up a website or have any

      sort of experience or a nap?

      And I'm going to trying

      navigators that yes, so please

      keep saying yes anyone ever in

      here somewhere?

      Let me come with the microphone.

      So probably won't because.

      But that is life in the big

      city.

      Thank you very much

    </p><p> Was brought up a website and

      I have two problems and I made

      the speech accidentally much

      faster than I was and I don't

      know how I did that.

    </p><p> You made it much faster than

      you was.

    </p><p> Now I can't scroll on my

      website.

    </p><p> Presenter: It looks like,

      what are you seeing visually

      they hang out?

      Oh it seems to be very fast.

      You might be zoomed in.

      So there's kind of an advance

      what to do this.

      Basically, this is the trick is

      just or the at the beginning,

      basically for taking two fingers

      like you're pinching but he

      wanted then turn it like a

      clock.

      So show you how to do it but is

      not connect -- here we go -- and

      that's called a rotor.

      It's kind like you're turning a

      dial like an old-fashioned dial

      in the way you want to do is

      find speech rate but you and

      swipe up or down to change the

      speaking rate.

      Is that good?

      Excellent.

    </p><p> Thank you.

    </p><p> That's a ethical Chester

      Borough people struggle with it.

      They can have promoter score

      reason still to be able to do

      that. Basically just if it works

      for you. It was great to turn it

      off if those too hard.

      Not as far as I know.

      Does anyone else -- does anyone

      else have an experience of

      opening a website may be trying

      out labels are looking at images

      during anything like that?

      I bet people are struggling to

      open a website right now that

      anyone open a nap and has an

      experience with the app, but

      still are? --

      you want to tell us what you

      tried?

    </p><p> I tried this court, to social

      media app I use on a daily

      basis.

    </p><p> what was your experience?

    </p><p> What it not as accessible as

      I thought it would be.

    </p><p> Presenter: I used this court

      to come in the way that they

      implemented it I think they made

      a mistake, so if you try to

      swipe up or down on discord it

      reverses it.

      If you swept up the ghost.

      If you swipe up it goes up. They

      did it -- so what implemented it

      not really knowing how

      voice-over works.

      It still usable but it's a

      normal experience of using a

      screen reader is that things are

      pretty wonky.

      So you have to learn the ins and

      out of all the different things.

      Unfortunate but that's how it is

      it is what it is.

    </p><p> I know I'm like a Mack, they

      actually ask if you're using a

      screen reader at least as I've

      explained stay.

    </p><p> Presenter: At that one is a

      bit of an Etsy practice because

      of an aggressive effort for

      right now thank you.

      Go ahead -- tap and then take

      two fingers and sweat down.

      Talk from the top of the page to

      the bottom. And then keep

      reading continuously they go.

      That gives you different

      options.

      So one of them is -- exactly

      they can swipe with one finger

      up and down to change the

      speaking rate.

      Nines will navigate lot lines. I

      got to close it out not come

      back okay.

      Yes.

      I went to close it out then come

      around.

      Thank you.

      So, it's a little bit of a

      difficult gesture but if you

      take your finger intend like a

      dial and then find speaking rate

      and then press it once you have

      it swipe up or down to make it

      faster or slower.

    </p><p> Oh, okay, thank you.

    </p><p> Presenter: X all right.

      We had a couple of interesting

      experiences.

      Within a close up or let me

      highlight a few expenses people

      had.

      Number one was we have someone

      use the app discord, and there

      was some ugly implemented

      behavior that have also

      experienced. If you swipe up,

      it's it goes down. If you swipe

      down a close out.

      So it is inverted. That's pretty

      normal for screen readers

      because apps have implemented in

      different ways.

      And most often the experiences

      but sometimes they think you

      have to learn new things they

      don't work and that's normal.

      If you are interested in going a

      little further testing things

      out, to apps that might be

      interesting for you to explore

      other Twitter app, and they did

      find their accessibility team

      and they're popping up there all

      the time and the Honorable

      Avenue which you think an

      audiobook player was a pretty

      accessible but actually it is

      but I have some pretty hot

      implementations and labels.

      Two is actually pretty

      interesting use because it

      should be really blind friendly

      but it's fine it's an

      interesting want to exploit.

      So let me wrap things out here.

      Is -- so -- I would like to

      say -- let's go to the last

      page.

      I want to say, for civil how do

      you turn this thing off?

      So, I hope that it's been

      interesting and actually have

      found that whenever -- it's

      about five or 10% of people who

      tried this they don't use if

      everything is allowed.

      But they find some use cases for

      it.

      And I know there's a woman that

      I know her eye sit tight in the

      evening and she cited, but she

      uses voice-over to listen to

      articles and so on. And they are

      people who have expenses like

      that.

      One person uses screen curtain,

      or actually color inverts so he

      doesn't wake up as has been in

      the morning.

      Which is investor testability

      feature.

      But that's access for you, like

      dark modern example is a feature

      that was adopted by everybody.

      Because a lot of people like

      dark motor on the screen.

      Saudi make a difference with all

      of this? I would say, if you

      learned just a little bit and

      you have you on that screen

      readers and users now you cannot

      go back.

      But you know a little bit it.

      And you know how to pull up a

      website and try things out.

      But, what you should do is if

      your organization makes a

      website you don't have to be an

      accessibility consulting genius

      open up your iOS open up the

      screen reader and see if things

      are labeled and check that it is

      saying.

      Check that it's making ends

      working. Given the feedback and

      it'll make you more valuable to

      the organization.

      It's a use for sale and it

      doesn't necessarily require that

      you learn every little W tackle

      whatever.

      And the other thing you can do

      it this is try to create a bug

      report.

      And in his accessibility.

      They do listen to accessibility

      requests Apple does, you can

      tell them about bugs in iOS, or

      if these app developers you can

      check them down on email and

      check them down the source

      medium-term Twitter and say hey

      discord when I swipe up because

      up you know -- it doesn't go

      down.

      You can say that today.

      And phase a lot more Black

      people than you think.

      And it is helpful to you kind of

      add your voice to our voices

      when you know and when you

      advocate for us a little bit. So

      that's a wrap to the screen

      reader thing.

      The only thing I haven't told

      you is how to turn it off.

      So in the games in the same

      process of turning it on hold

      down your Syria button or the

      home button of the button on the

      top if you don't have a home

      button and say voice-over off.

      And the other thing you can do

      is use -- going to the menu go

      to settings and go to the

      accessibility settings which are

      usually about five items below

      in general.

      And then the first item in

      accessibility setting is

      voice-over going there and

      toggle it off.

      And there will be a warning,

      they go the voice-overs of.

      And then, there is a toggle

      hitting and they'll be a warning

      thing, and what's it's off you

      might not be able to hear your

      device and go ahead and say yes

      I want to turn it off and that

      of the turnoff.

      All right. Thank you very much

      and thus the end of this

      screenreader workshop.

      So, it seems like Janice Cano

      wrap us out here.

      And before she does can we just

      you may give a round of applause

      for June.

      [Applause]

      And I would also like to see a

      couple of words about the power

      that you guys have as potential

      advocates for people who are

      disabled.

      First of all, I hope -- there is

      a preaching to the choir and

      then another stuff, but people

      who care enough to come to an

      event like this and said to us

      and listen to a stock it's

      greatly appreciated. I would

      say, if you are new to

      accessibility, for sitting in

      one of the seats they have a

      talk too much about and you find

      it interesting Caswell, you now

      know more than a lot of people

      in your organization and almost

      everyone unfortunately.

      Depending on what organization

      you're in.

      So, I'm not saying that you

      necessarily need to adopt that

      mental -- but, now that you ramp

      this position annoying a bit

      more about accessibility, it is

      important that if you do decide

      to advocate in your own

      organization and there's a lot

      of ways you can do that if your

      teacher, this many teachers and

      technologies here.

      They are students and

      researchers.

      If you are a teacher, look out

      for disabled students.

      But also think about using

      accessible materials and assume

      you do have assessable students

      in your class, and Caswell.

      Not every student will come up

      and tell you about it.

      And you will be surprised.

      When I was in college I did not

      tell all of my professors that I

      could not see the blackboard you

      know so think about making

      things a little bit more

      multimodal by giving people

      resources that are you just talk

      in front of class.

      And incorporating some of these

      practices into your classroom.

      If your research or think about

      the kinds of papers you publish.

      And think about how you make it

      up available. And think about

      the kinds of papers you write.

      And think about equations and

      how unstructured you are and are

      you using a tool that will make

      those equations readable to

      blind people.

      Often is not much Michael work

      but if you think about it like

      Nasdaq election make those

      equations readable.

      And, if you are technologies,

      you guys are the ones who fill

      the stuff that we use.

      And you decide how it works and

      you decide if it's gonna be

      semantic and decide if people

      are going to be able to use that

      technology.

      And I know you don't always have

      that power you cannot shove it

      in the right direction can make

      a big difference for a lot of

      people.

      So now Jan will close and so,

      but one of us can make you be an

      advocate, but if you do choose

      to be an advocate he can make an

      enormous difference.

      Honestly, even coming out and

      supporting in this day of

      accessibility, it is an

      incredible -- it's incredible.

      I know some people have been

      above more emotional similar

      talks today and I'm one of them.

      It really means a lot to have

      people sit in the seats and

      think about accessibility and

      stem and an astronomy and to

      include more people in this very

      cool research thank you for

      that. So let me now give it over

      to Jan.

    </p><p> Jenn: thank you.

      Okay.

      So, we are at 5 minutes out,

      were basically down. Let us just

      wrap this up.

      I want to thank everyone so much

      for coming today and for the

      people online -- he really means

      a lot that you all came and

      engage with all of this.

      And I hope you're able to leave

      a little bit more knowledgeable

      about accessibility and a little

      more interested maybe thinking

      some steps to when you're

      creating things or poking things

      making sure that what you build

      is accessible.

      And, please tell everyone you

      know and share your resources in

      all these talks, they would post

      it online both the recordings of

      the talks and any slides that

      were used. There actually

      already posted on the schedule.

      And, as we are wrapping up if

      you have an iPad please return

      it to me before you leave.

      Okay.

      Maybe you raise your hand they

      will collect some of the iPads.

      Please do not speak up with one.

      Also, if you have a listening

      device, that's another device we

      headed out to some people that

      he could also please get that

      back as well.

      Okay.

      Also, I want to take a bunch of

      people for helping out with this

      event. We have folks on AZ, and

      moderator, we have a lot of

      people coming to organize and

      plan and all of our amazing

      speakers, and Josh Miele for

      coming on the way out from

      California.

      [Applause] --

      and I also think we got a lot --

      we listen to a lot of

      interesting things and I hope it

      percolates and you find it

      interesting.

      And I hope we'll have a nice

      rest of today.

      Goodbye.

      [Laughter]
