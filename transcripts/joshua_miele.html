<section id="transcript">

<p> Hey, we are going to start in

just a few minutes, we want to

wait for a few people to come

back though.

So talk amongst yourselves.

Okay, we are going to get

started in just a minute if you

want to take your seat.

Waiting for one group to walk in

here.

All right, so my name is Patrick

Smyth, I am a chief learner at

Iota School.

We do infrastructure development

and teaching and curriculum

development and accessibility

work.

We have more people coming in.

And I am also a -- well, I'm a

technologist and teacher and

researcher, so it's kind of my

utmost pleasure to introduce

Joshua Miele or Dr. Josh mealy

who is someone who has done

things that I truly admire your.

So I will start from the

beginning.

Josh got her gutters undergrad

at in physics at UC Berkeley,

and I did not know about this

when we invited you out, Josh,

but I read that you had an

internship at NASA which is

pretty cool, so that's a

connection. But then he went on

to get his PhD also at UC

Berkeley, and then Josh spent

many years at Smith eye

Institute from 2007 to 2019

where he was associate Director

of research and development and

there he worked on some truly

amazing projects, so they

include team map, so I looked at

this 20 times, and -- the

tactile map automated production

which essentially allows you to

print and embossed a braille

map -- from a home braille and

officer.

He also which sounded like an

incredible undertaking helped

create a tactile map for the

entire board system including

lab formats and street-level map

which sounds like an incredible

undertaking.

He has created systems for

typing using haptic feedback,

and has also been in projects

like you describe which is a

crowd source system for creating

and hosting audio descriptions

for YouTube videos.

In one my personal favorites is

the blind Arduino project which

is this incredible learning

websites which I have used a

couple of times.

Or we know that they are

microcomputers you can use for

all sorts of maker projects

wearables and all kinds of stuff

and just some really cool geeky

stuff on the website that I

really enjoyed. So Josh now

since 2019 has moved on to

Amazon, lab 126-4126, where he

is the principal accessibility

researcher has worked on things

such as braille accessibility

and the fire tablet.

Again Josh has some really cool

big ideas I have enjoyed

listening to him over the years

talk about.

Which I'm hoping he will talk a

little bit more about but

combining different accessible

modalities, audio with haptics,

but another one I have really

enjoyed his this idea of Meda

making which is the idea of

bootstrapping your way if a tool

for creating other things are in

are an accessible, like you

create tools to create tools and

bootstrap your way into making

amazing projects and technology.

So -- and of course in 2021,

Josh was -- he received a

MacArthur Fellowship recognizing

all those contributions in

accessibility and technology.

So I would like to welcome Josh

to space telescope Institute. So

I hope you give him a round of

applause.

[Applause]

</p><p> Thanks so much, but I think

you have pretty much covered it,

so we can just go to lunch.

I'm super pleased to be here.

Thank you for that great

introduction and the invitation

to speak to you here at the day

of accessibility for space

telescope science Institute,

which you know, I am a nerd.

I am just thrilled to be here

and it's really exciting.

So what we are going to do, I am

not -- you know, I'm giving you

the most accessible PowerPoint

presentation in existence, they

are no slides.

Thank you.

Yes, plod, go ahead, that's

fine.

And as a blind student, a blind

scientist, a blind everything,

I -- PowerPoint is just not that

great.

So not only do I hate preparing

slides, but I -- it always makes

me sad when people are giving

these great presentations and

they are sort of talking more

about the slides and they are

about the thing that they are

really talking about.

So no slides and if you want

books online, it's perfectly

accepts acceptable coming you

can walk away from the screen,

treat it like a podcast, there's

nothing the cedar.

So I just want to give you a

quick overview of what we are

going to try to cover today.

I have -- I will give you a

little background on who I am

and where I came from a sort of

why I wound up in accessibility

and talk about some of the

projects that were mentioned.

And kind of try to give you a

sense of why I do the things I

do and to help you think about

ways that you can improve

accessibility as well for

yourself and for everyone else.

I know there are many people

here today who are students with

disabilities, their teachers and

parents and disability in

education professionals.

I know that there are a bunch of

folks for home -- there should

be a nice way to pronounce

STScI, how do you pronounce

that?

Sticy?

There are a lot of stuff from

the Institute, so I'm going to

try to offer something of

interest to everyone.

I'm going to kind of come at

this from the angle of telling

you sort of -- you know, I

mention I'm a blind scientist, a

blind researcher, activist, and

I put blind first.

I'm not a person who happens to

be blind. I am blind and

everything that I do and I am

proud of it. And I'm not trying

to minimize it or make people

sore day of not attention to it.

I did not always have that

attitude.

When I was young I really did

not want people to pay attention

to it.

I did want to minimize it.

And in some ways that serve me

well, but in other ways it

didn't.

So I just want to sort of tell

you that my ultimate journey as

a person with a disability, as a

blind person, my my thinking is

that the more that you are

upfront and direct about your

disability and what you need in

order to interact and succeed in

the world, the better off you

will be in the better off

everyone else will be.

The better off the people around

you will be, because there will

be clarity about what you need

and how you needed.

Again to better off will be the

people who come after you who we

are always clearing the path for

the next generation, even if you

are really young, there will be

people coming behind you who are

the next generation and who you

will be treading that path for

before they get there and making

it, stamping down the snow and

making it better, easier, and

more possible for them to

succeed in doing the things that

they want to do.

Which is ultimately what

accessibility is all about. So

let's talk about briefly how I

think about accessibility.

And it's really, I go back to

you -- I am a physicist.

I like to go back to first

principles.

And I think about accessibility

not as an exhaustive checklist

on the W3C website, not as a

thing, a set of things in the

508 laws, but as a set design

requirement in the design

requirements are based on who

you are -- who you are working

with and what the situation is.

So really there is no -- you

have to go back to the beginning

in order to understand what

accessibility means in any

particular situation.

So whenever someone says, we

need to make this accessible.

The first question you should

ask is, accessible for who?

And the way we have been

thinking about universal design

over the last couple of decades

or so is basically we try to

make something as -- we try to

think of as many situations as

we can and build in as much

stuff as we can to make as many

people be able to use that thing

is possible.

We are thinking of it a little

bit differently now, and that is

more in terms of

customizability.

The ability for anybody to be

able to turn on or off or

activate or deactivate, or

engage with them or not engage

with parts of the experience to

adapt it to what they need.

Ultimately what we are trying to

do with accessibility is make

a -- make the experience whether

it is an architect with the

building or a city or a class or

website or you know a computer.

Any of these things, we are

trying to make it so that a

person with a disability can use

it in pretty much the same way

as somebody else would use it.

Not the same way. Let me

rephrase that.

With pretty much the same

experience that someone else can

use it.

There may be -- you may use it

differently, you may need to use

more keyboard commands rather

than a mouse. You may need to

read the braille on room numbers

rather than looking at the

print, there are different ways

of accessing information, but

ultimately you want the person

to be able to access that

experience coming want to make

it an equivalent experience,

right?

So what story I often tell is

think about going up to a

beautiful building and you know,

there is this grand

architecture, the San Francisco

City Hall is a great example.

It's like this beautiful Art

Deco building with a dome on top

and lots of stained-glass and a

huge sweeping steps up to the

front doors, and he rolled up in

a wheelchair and you know, you

can't walk up those steps and

grand atrium.

You roll back and you going to a

side entrance.

You go through the basement

coming from the service

elevator.

You go up the service elevator,

you roll out of a dusty hallway

and into the atrium.

You got there, but you did not

have the same experience of

getting there that a person who

just walks up the steps does.

So I don't think that's

accessible.

You got there, you were able to

achieve it, but you didn't have

the same experience.

He did not have that grand

entrance.

And accessibility needs to, we

need to think about the

experience, not just the

compliance. Not just does it

work, but is it delightful?

Is it giving you the same

experience as was intended by

the original design? And that's

why, so you know, I could talk

about this for super long time.

But I think the point being that

if it takes you ten times longer

with a string reader to do

something than it takes somebody

else without a screenwriter,

yeah, okay, you can do it,

maybe, but that's not

accessible.

That is not -- you are not

getting the same thing out of

that.

And so growing up as a blind kid

going through school, you know?

I felt like I -- a lot of the

time it seemed like I was

inventing stuff for the first

time.

I had to, like there were things

that I had to work with my

teachers and with my TBI, my

braille teacher to come up with

systems for how am I going to do

geometry?

Going to do chemistry?

In short, there were tools like

Braille and other things, but I

want to emphasize how important

tactical graphics word to me in

learning and stem education,

right?

I studied, I took a lot of math

in high school, because I don't

know, I liked it.

And I took a lot of science, and

without the assistance of the

teachers and the other students,

my lab partners and so on, I

would not have been able to do

it.

I would not have been able to

get access to the tactical

graphics or the materials.

There weren't any accessible

balances for measuring out

chemicals. I had to work with

the lab partner.

They had to tell me what was

going on.

So this opens up the question of

what is independence?

Independence is often thought of

as doing something yourself?

But I think in accessibility a

lot of the time we need to think

a little bit more broadly about

independence. Independence is

really control over how things

unfold. A lot of the time you

may not have an accessible

instrument that you need to --

in order to do your science lab.

You may not have accessible

graphics, not everybody gets the

privilege of having tactical

graphics for everything they

need.

So you need someone to describe

it.

But the more control you as the

consumer of that, the student

have over that process, the

better.

And I would sort of offer sort

of control or agency as another

dimension of accessibility and

independence.

So growing up, these -- having

access to the tactical graphics

was really important. And it fed

my love of maps and all access

to information.

By the way, that's how I think

of myself as as researcher who

studies the accessibility of

information.

That's largely what blind people

need is better access to

information, different books

with different disabilities need

different types of access for if

you are using a chair, one of

the things that you need is

architectural access.

So for me growing up and as a

student and later as a

scientist, I was constantly

trying to figure out how to get

access to the information I need

in order to do the things that I

want to do?

So that has really motivated a

lot of the work that I've done.

Example, when I was in graduate

school, everybody was using

Matlab.

How many of you have heard of

Matlab? Just say "me."

So thank God notebooks weren't

invented yet, because otherwise

I might not have graduated.

But I -- in my lab everybody was

using Matlab.

It's basically like XL on

steroids.

It's data management

manipulation and visualization

engine which is -- has its own

little programming language that

is very much like C and has a

bunch of rendering tools were

displaying data.

And so it was really cool,

because the command line was all

driven by a command line that

was really easy to use.

The data visualization stuff was

completely inaccessible.

So all of my colleagues were

using Matlab to not only create

their -- their stimuli and

manage their data sets, but also

to create a pretty graphics

presentations.

And also not just further

presentations, but in order to

analyze data, right?

Data visualization is super

useful in -- for figuring out

what your data needs.

That's what they are for.

So I did not have access to any

of that.

So I spent the first year of

grad school writing Matlab

toolbox for personification and

tactile output.

So I wrote basically a set of

tools that would turn my data

into sounds that I could

understand and interpret and

then for the data that I wanted

to really dig into, I wanted to

print it out and feel it.

I wanted to tactile

representation. I wanted XY axes

and to see my scatterplot and my

aero bars and all of the things

that I would need in order to

interpret and understand my

data. So I wrote this tool and

said this is an example of what

we were talking about -- sorry,

I am blanking on the guy who

introduced me, his name?

Patrick. I was like -- Patrick.

Okay.

Patrick mentioned this whole

moneymaker thing, right?

Where I am basically convinced

the people with disabilities are

put in the situations where they

can't do the thing that they

want to do like go to grad

school and use the same tools as

everybody else.

And so what happens is you have

to create the tools needed in

order to do before you can

actually do the real thing that

you wanted to do.

So in writing these tools I

became a total Matlab bad ass.

And it served me really for the

next four years good when I got

out of grad school and got a

postdoc at Smith Kettlewell, so

that's a cool place where

basically one of the group said

they have really focuses on

development research and

development of accessible tools

for blind people, around stem. A

lot of it is around stem.

So the first thing I did was,

you know, as I mentioned I have

always love maps.

And I have always been, this is

a long -- how old are you guys?

This was in 2001, okay, when I

started my postdoc.

And there were no Google Maps

yet.

Maps were a thing that you

either had on paper or if you

are like a real nerd, you had

access to GIS and some digital

maps.

There was a thing called believe

it or not, Yahoo was the big the

big map provider at the time.

And so I was like, I want to

maps for blind people.

Because there were starting to

be the street maps were starting

to be readily available online

for everybody.

And I thought, well I want that.

I want to be able to look at

street maps.

Because when I go to a new place

the only choice I have is either

getting detailed descriptions of

the street network and trying to

remember it or just go there and

get lost.

And that's usually what I would

do. I would just leave three

hours early so that I could like

find my way to the place that I

was actually trying to get to.

Which is coming you know, again,

is that -- if I have to leave

three hours early, that's not

really equitable or accessible.

So I proposed as my first

postdoc project this project

where I would create tactile, I

would use an algorithmic

approach to producing tactile

street maps of any place in the

country. And in order to do

that, I had to learn all about

GIS. I had to learn all about

how to render tactile maps. I

had to do a bunch of research on

sort of what kind of information

people wanted and could use on

tactile maps. Because

obviously, I am blind.

But I'm not every blind person.

So all the work that I have done

over the course of my career,

you must do customer research.

User research. You can't assume

anything about what to you --

own preference is and it's not

what everybody might want.

So there are for as many

different kinds of blind people

as their aura, there are that

many different kinds of use

cases and needs.

So it's always really important

to -- to work with the community

of people that are going to be

using the tools that you are

developing in order to make sure

that there -- that they are

usable.

As a blind person I don't have

to start from square one trend.

I can start from square 5.

Because I can eliminate the

things that I know about ideas.

And sort of start working with

the things that -- the options

that I know are sort of within

reason and then get feedback.

So I did that with the maps. In

these maps -- so the team map

for the first time allowed blind

people to have access to pretty

much any street map they want

anywhere in the world for free,

or at low cost.

So I for a number of years sort

of rented as a research project

and then spun it off to the San

Francisco lighthouse who now

owns it and maintains it.

And you can get in touch with

them at lighthouse -- SF --.org

to get any street map you want.

They also have a website that

you can go to and you can

download and print out your own

street maps, or you can have

them do it for you for a fee. So

this project lives on and is a

great example of -- oh, by the

way. I did not tell you, I built

it from Matt lab, that's all I

knew how to do, so it was with

kind of chewing gum and other

stuff and when the lighthouse

took it over, they rebuilt it as

a mature web-based app that uses

appropriate API and all of that.

So it's real thing.

So I just -- that's an example

of the kind of tool that I think

is really amazing.

So Patrick mentioned, U

described which is another

approach that I get for access

to video.

I've done a lot of work and

video description technologies

and thinking about how we can --

how we can get better access to

audio description of videos for

education, for entertainment,

for training and employment, all

of these things.

Video accessibility is hugely

important, as important as text

accessibility I would say and

so -- but I can probably talk

about all of the various

projects I've done, but I'm

going to jump to talking about

the blind project, because I

think it illustrates a bunch of

the things that I think are

really important.

Before, well, let's eat. I will

also tell you, Patrick mentioned

I am at Amazon now. And I'm not

going to talk a lot about what I

do at Amazon.

You know, there's plenty -- you

can read online about that.

I love doing what I do there.

But in my transition to Amazon,

I thought about like -- I had

been working at this research

Institute for years and years.

I wanted to sort of scale up my

impact on the world.

I wanted to do accessibility not

just research and development

projects that I would publish

about and show demos on earth,

but he wanted to do things that

would really reach people and

help people do the things they

wanted to do.

And so I started thinking about

like oh, how can I get a job in

tech?

And I found a recruiter online

who -- I put together a resume

of all of the work that I had

done and sent this recruiter my

resume.

And basically said I was a

desire. --

designer.

Because what a deal, I often

work with engineers and other

folks.

I am not writing the code

necessarily for -- I did not

write the code for you describe.

It's -- once you get to these

projects at a certain level of

complexity, you can do it by

yourself.

Again, its independence, what is

that? Need other people to help

you do things.

So I had designed you describe.

And team map, actually I made

team map myself.

But there were a bunch of other

projects where was the designer

and sort of the project lead. So

I sent my resume to this design

recruiter and she called me

back, and she said, you know,

and I had told her eye was

blind.

And she said coming you know, I

think it's so interesting you

think you can be a blind

designer.

And I said, you know, I think so

interesting that you think you

are going to help me get a job.

So obviously she was not going

to be very helpful.

And I said this to illustrate

that technology is really cool,

technology is helpful,

accessibility is the technical

and the disability inclusion.

And what we are really -- the

technical parts aren't actually

that hard.

They are sometimes very

difficult, but they are just

implementation details.

The hard part is the social

engineering.

The social dynamics of ableism

and you no, figuring out how to

change attitudes in the world,

not just among people without

disabilities, but there are

plenty of internalized ableism

among our own people to prevent

us from achieving what we are

capable of.

So the blind are doing a project

sort of what gets at all of it.

The technical stuff, the social

stuff, and that's my favorite

kind of project.

And what I do in the blind

Armanino project is to work with

other people to teach and

develop training materials for

showing blind people how to work

with this micro process or

platform.

</p><p> How many of you know what it

is?

How many of you don't know what

it is?

That's a lot of people.

So it is a little computer on a

circuit board that is open

source, it is cheap, and it is

available everywhere.

And it is sort of the heart of

the hobby robotics movement.

So when you are a -- when you

are working in your hobby

robotics club or whatever, there

are -- there is a good chance

the things that you are building

with our Ardmino computers, you

can write a program, you can

load them on from your computer

and then you can approach that

board to all kinds of switches,

buttons, sensors, motors,

lights, buzzers, switches,

oxygen sensors, you know, you

name it whether it is a sensor

or an actuator, you can connect

it and you can tell your program

when I push this button, do

this.

Or when you detect a certain

temperature, do that.

Or when the lights go off do

this other thing.

And the doing can be anything

from connecting motors and

driving some physical process to

sending out a tweet or doing

song cloud-based thing.

So it's super cool and flexible

and you can build the kind of

stuff with it in an afternoon

that, when I was a kid we

would've had to of had a team oh

5:00 p.m. engineers and

stability.

So I mean, it's really flexible

and powerful.

And so what I'm interested in

doing is number one teaching

people how to build their own

accessible equipment which these

Ardminos.

Actually number one showing them

you can work with these things

come you don't need to know what

colors the wires are.

There are alternate methods.

You don't be able to need and

read the numbers, all you need

us alternate documentation that

is an accessible form.

There are workarounds, ways of

doing these things.

And part of what I want to do is

show one kids and adults that

they can do this.

A part of I want to do a show

teachers and club managers that

they can do this.

And I have run workshops where I

teach soldering or other basics,

and I will say, you know, how

many of you guys in your school

have a robotics club?

And these are all blind kids,

10-15 or 16, whatever. Everyone

will say coming usually

mainstreamed.

Everyone will save me, my school

has a robotics club.

We went to the first robotics

thing last year or whatever.

I will say, how many of you are

in the robotics club in your

school, and there is silence

because these STEM opportunities

for kids that can see, kids

without disabilities, the

teachers do not understand how

to include blank lids.

How to include kids with

disabilities into the robotics

club. So that means that these

kids aren't going to have the

same level of experience coming

out of junior high or high

school, or going into college.

They are not going to be up --

they are not going to have the

same level of background in the

same experience as the cited

kids. They're not going to be

as capable as cited kids to

going to STEM fields.

So it has a snowball effect that

when people are excluded from

learning experiences, it affects

their entire future, and not

just the future of the

individual, but the future of

our society.

Because when blank lids do learn

these things, by the way, it's

not just blind kids that learned

these things, but cited kids and

learn alongside them, and

grown-ups learn.

And it is collaboration.

It's not -- I'm not trying to

build a blind-only world.

This world includes all of us.

And kind of accessibility is

everybody's responsibility.

It's the responsibility of

people with disabilities to say

what we need, and to make sure

it gets built right in ways that

meet our needs, it's the

responsibility of teachers to

make sure that they know how to

teach kids with disabilities. So

that in the future when these

kids are in the tech world's

getting tech jobs doing tech

things that accessibility is no

longer -- I think that we are

coming to a place where

accessibility will not be this

thing that people think about

after they release an accessible

product, but things will be

moving in a direction where

technologies are born

accessible, because we have

people with disabilities at

every level in the tech world.

In the world where these things

are coming from. We only produce

an accessible tools when the

people producing them don't

realize that there is a need.

If we had people with

disabilities working in tech and

software and in hardware

everywhere, there would not be

that excuse.

I do not even think that blind

people would need that.

They do. We do. And so the

project is this long-term social

engineering project not only to

teach about accessible design,

but to teach him to build their

own tools when they need them so

that they can do things they

actually want to do.

But it is for the teachers and

the parents, it's for the future

people who will be developing

the accessibility of four dances

the future so that as I said, we

don't need to -- the people who

come behind you don't need to

call up a recruiter and say oh,

how interesting.

I am not in the robotics club

because I am blind.

That's not the world where I

want to live, and I don't think

that's a world where you want to

live.

So I guess my take away is that

disability and accessibility

are -- accessibility is a key

component of disability

inclusion, but it is only the

technical part of it.

Again our real challenge and

responsibility in true

broad-spectrum disability from a

societal standpoint is that we

need to figure out how to shift

our social expectations so that

we are not surprised when there

are people with disabilities

working in every job.

And maybe that's a little

grandiose, but that's where I

want to go.

That's where I want to encourage

you to be thinking about as the

end game for disability and

inclusion.

And I love that the

unpronounceable space telescope

science Institute has this as

part of their mission.

And this is why we do the alt

text. This is why we do the

Jupiter notebooks.

Without accessible Jupiter

notebooks, we will not be

producing future scientists who

need the accessibility features

of notebooks.

Without good alt text, we will

not be inspiring people to

become astronomers and

scientists.

So I'm going to just say again,

thank you for inviting me.

Thank you for hosting the event

and I would love to take

questions if there are any.

</p><p> Jenn: Thank you so much, that

was wonderful. We have 12

minutes, oh, I see someone right

here.

</p><p> Patrick: Remember to say her

name.

</p><p> What was your favorite part

that you made or project to that

help to you?

</p><p> What was the favorite project

that you made?

</p><p> Josh: Thanks for the

question. You know, I -- I love

all of my babies equally.

But I have to say, you describe

is -- I am super proud of it,

because it is -- not only

does -- it's basically a website

that lets anybody anywhere go to

watch a YouTube video and add

audio description to it.

You can do in line or extended

audio description. You can

record it with your voice and it

plays back -- when anyone else

anywhere else in the world can

watch that video with your audio

description, any number of

people can add their own so you

can have multiple audio

description tracks and there is

no -- and it does not violate

the YouTube terms of service.

And it is basically like -- I

love technologies that invite us

to think differently about what

accessibility really means.

And when you have got an

audio -- you know, if you turn

on audio description you

basically have one option for

audio description and at some

sort of authoritative voice of

God that tells you what to the

description is.

And it's like, you know,

sometimes especially for social,

that's kind of okay for big

blockbusters may be, but for

social media, for other videos,

there are other voices in other

ways to describe.

Like if I post a video on

YouTube for my buddies of you

know, a ridiculous birthday

situation where the cake falls

on the mud or whatever. I don't

want -- like I want to describe

that in a certain way for my

friends.

And somebody else may want to

describe it in a totally

different way.

Audio description is not

one-size-fits-all.

And I think that is really cool

to -- I love that there is a

tool that invites other voices,

like teenagers and elders and

folks who are huge subject

matter expertise.

You know, if I am a scientist

watching a video about a science

demo, I'm going to describe that

differently from the way a

kindergarten teacher would

describe it. And I think that U

describe thinks that we can

create differently about what

description is in general. I

think description by the way

that we should think of

description as an accessibility

tool almost like no other.

If you think about it, all a

screenwriter is is a tool for

description really.

</p><p> Any other questions?

I see at hand. Let's start over

here.

</p><p> Hello, my name is Jamin.

What project are you most

involved in. And nice to me.

</p><p> Josh: My day job at Amazon

keeps me super busy.

And I do a lot of stuff in

Amazon that I love doing. It is

extremely fulfilling phone work.

What we do there is help make

the Amazon devices such as fire

TV and fire tablets more

accessible for customers with

disabilities. That is one of my

favorite went back favorite

projects that I'm working on at

work.

Personally I have a lot of

smaller projects that I work on.

I am the blind Arduino project

is something I'm heavily working

on.

Also starting a nonprofit that

is called the Center for

accessibility at open source.

It is intended to support the

accessibility of open source and

open source accessibility.

And I am super excited to talk

to the notebook people about

that a little bit.

</p><p> We are excited to talk to you

too.

</p><p> Plugging out of here.

</p><p> So those are the kinds of

things that I am actively

engaged in right now.

Other questions?

Like where is lunch?

</p><p> A couple of more minutes

before lunch.

</p><p> Thank you.

My name is Kelsey Brown, I am at

the Aerospace Museum in D.C. I

was wondering -- I know this is

a whole conversation, but if you

have any quick suggestions or

recommendations for things that

institutions like museums can do

to support your work and to

support accessibility.

I know that the whole thing.

But if there are a few things we

can just do better in your

experience.

</p><p> Josh: Well the first and most

important thing is to engage

people with disabilities not

just the trends, not just

advisory boards, but employees

and experts.

There's a big difference between

somebody who just lives with a

disability and deals with stuff

for themselves and somebody who

is -- has a disability and a

lived experience and is also an

expert providing accessibility.

So the zero order solution is to

make sure that there are people

with disabilities who are

accessibility experts working in

the museums and the

accessibility areas.

And on the second most important

thing I would say is make sure

that the people at the front

desk are well informed about

what accessibility offerings you

have.

</p><p> Hi, my name is Kyle.

Still I was just wondering if

you can create technology that

will tell you when to cross the

street or like have a voice

system where it can go through a

traffic light.

How would it tell whether it is

safe to cross or not?

</p><p> Josh: I will ask you to

repeat it or ask someone to help

me understand.

</p><p> He can repeat it, but I think

I heard what he asked.

</p><p> Was it that you would like

someone to maybe start working

on an invention that would allow

people with a visual impairment

to know when it's safe to cross

the street that is a wearable.

</p><p> That's a really interesting

problem.

And that is -- there are, you

know, people love that problem.

I have a little Google alert

that I -- that tells me whenever

there is somebody publishing

about disability technology,

travel, and there are so many

little projects that people

create to that sort of try to

help blind people navigate in

the world, try to help blind

people cross the street.

Try to help people do this or

that.

And I think it's so interesting,

because so many of them don't

really start from what people

really need.

So often the people that are --

they are well-intentioned.

But they don't have

disabilities. They aren't

blind, they don't have any blind

people working with them, they

just sort of watch some movie

about blind people and they

think they know what blind

people need.

So you know, substituting myth

and prejudice for market

research.

And I think that there are lots

of tools that would -- first of

all, nothing is ever going to

tell you that it is safe to

cross the street, right?

The liability is out of control.

So there are legal reasons why

people aren't making devices

that sort of help people make

decisions about when it is safe

to cross the street.

I think there are some really

interesting tools that we could

use.

For example, there is a thing

called visual looming, which

basically you can use a camera

to tell when something is

approaching you or moving away

from you.

And it does not have to do any

fancy object detection.

It does not have to do any fancy

sort of identification of what

things are.

But at a very simple image

processing level, you can really

easily and quickly tell whether

something is coming towards you

and how fast it is coming

towards you.

And that's really something that

would be very useful for folks

to know.

Any other requirement on nothing

like that is to give you

information in a way that does

not interfere with the rest

of -- you need to listen, you

need to pay attention to what

you were auditory cues are. And

also needs to be like no

latency. Like I don't want to

know five seconds later that

there is a bike coming. I want

to know like the second there is

a bike coming.

Another really -- this is

another great example of where

open source accessibility tools

may wind up providing these

kinds of gadgets for us, because

if it is just an open source

tool, there's nobody to sue

really.

Right?

And whereas, the lawyers would

sort of -- if you left it in the

hands of the lawyers, we would

never get tools like that.

Because it is just there is too

much risk to the person that

provides the device.

</p><p> Okay, with that.

I think we have made it to

lunchtime.

Let's give another round of

applause!

[Applause]

Thank you so much, that was

wonderful.

So lunch is in the cafeteria, so

if you have been to the

bathrooms, it's down that

hallway and pass there.

If you have registered, there

are sandwiches and lunches and

drinks for everyone.

And yes, we will be back in an

hour.

I want to mention we have

several touchable graphics and

interactive exhibits set up in

the cafe as well. So I would

love if you all check that out.

Okay, see you back in one hour.

At 2:00 p.m.
</p>
