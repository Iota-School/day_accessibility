<p> Jen: We are starting to get

back going again.

I want to welcome the students

from Baltimore School for the

Blind, I'm so excited to have

all of you. Next up, we will

have Margaret Carruthers, a

science writer here at Space

Telescope Science Institute, she

is going to talk about the

incredibly detailed descriptions

of the James Webb first images,

referred to as "alt text,"

alternative text.

It was pretty big news when they

first came out, there were

articles on NPR, "Washington

Post," a lot of people were

talking about this alt text,

Margaret is one of the writers

that worked on the image

descriptions and she will be

sharing her process and how she

goes about writing those images

for the James Webb telescope.

There you go.

Thank you.

</p><p> Margaret: Okay, this is

working okay?

Everyone can hear me?

Thank you, Jen.

Welcome to the students that

just came in.

I am Margaret Carruthers, I'm a

science writer here at Space

Telescope, we are going to be

talking about the text

descriptions that we developed

for the first images and spectra

that came out from the James

Webb telescope last July.

I'm going to talk a bit about

the -- a tiny bit about the

telescope for those of you who

are not familiar with it, a bit

about the images and the whole

news package that we created.

I will talk about how we went

about writing and developing

those text descriptions and will

give you some samples. And then

I will give you some of our top

tips or things that we learned

along the way in doing this.

Also, I want to say this is the

first time -- I've been aware --

of presenting to a group who is

not able to see -- not everybody

can see the slides I am

presenting.

I will try to be aware of that

and try to remember to describe

the slides adequately.

Many apologies if I don't.

Please raise your hand if you

are like hey, what was that?

I'm going to do my best.

This is a new thing for me.

All right.

Our first slide, beautiful

picture of the Carina nebula,

where the stars are forming and

the name of the talk,

"Illuminating the Universe with

Accessible Text Descriptions."

For those that were not here for

Marc Postman's intro, we are

looking at telescopes that look

out into space, the Hubble space

telescope, I have a photograph

of the Hubble space telescope

orbiting Earth, the James Webb

telescope, an illustration of

that, orbiting the sun and the

Roman Space Telescope, still

probably in some hanger

somewhere.

[Laughs]

And a photograph of the people

here at Space Telescope Science

Institute, celebrating after --

in front of the building after

the day the images were

released.

We manage the telescopes and in

our office of public outreach,

we tell people about the

discoveries.

As Marc let you all know before,

we have four strategic goals and

I will focus on the third one,

making the world's astronomical

information accessible to all.

That means a lot of things.

As a science writer, it means

taking a complex concept and

explaining it such that somebody

who does not have expertise in

that can understand it, right?

We all have the capacity to

understand this information.

We just don't all have the prior

knowledge that is needed, right?

It also means distributing that

information.

Not just "we have information,"

but we have to get it out there.

A lot like print or meeting

people face-to-face, we still do

that, but now, we can distribute

things online and really reach a

huge number of people that way.

Increasingly, the accessibility

also means reaching even broader

audiences, audiences who had

come in many cases, been

neglected in the past.

Those that had been visually

impaired or otherwise, they

lacked access to the visuals we

had.

Maybe that was a technical or

physical problem -- Barrier.

Okay, let me go back a little

bit.

[Laughs]

In the office of public

outreach, we've got about 50

science communication

specialists of all realms, okay?

Science writers, I am just 1 of

7 or eight science writers, we

have graphic designers, some are

here in the audience.

[Laughs]

And we've got education

specialists, astronomers,

software developers, curators,

motion designers, animators, the

whole wide variety of people and

they all contribute to making

this astronomy accessible.

Okay, the James Webb space

telescope, what I have here is

an illustration of the James

Webb space telescope and also an

illustration -- a drawing

illustrating the variety of

science that Webb was designed

to do.

It's a million miles away from

us, looking toward all of these

galaxies that have now been

seen.

Trying to find out how these

galaxies formed, looking at

galaxies that are interacting

with each other to see how they

evolve over time, looking at

stars, just warming, baby stars.

And stars that are dying.

Maybe exploding.

It's looking at planets.

It is not looking at Earth or

the planets toward the sun but

it's looking at some of the

planets in our solar system like

Mars, Jupiter and it is also

looking at planets way, way far

away, orbiting other stars,

exoplanets.

Astronomers are super excited,

as they should be, we are

excited to tell you all about

it.

All right, okay.

Webb launched in December of

2021 and it spent about six

months controlled, by the way,

at Space Telescope, people

upstairs telling us what to do,

that he ready to collect the

data and start doing science.

On July 12th, last July, we were

finally ready to reveal this

data to the public and also to

the astronomy community.

July 12th, we released --

really, it was a set of six

articles about five different

targets that Webb looked at.

This information, this outreach

was intended to show the variety

of science that Webb can do, all

of the exciting things so that

people understand everything

that Webb is doing.

Fortunately, it did not

disappoint.

A whole lot of other things you

can hear about how it is

exceeding all expectations.

I am really here to talk to you

about the news package and how

we got that information out.

What we have on the screen are

six screenshots of the headlines

and images, the first images and

spectra, we had an overview

article, an article about

galaxies colliding, black holes,

a dying star, the southern ring

nebula, we had one about a field

of galaxies, very distant, where

new stars, baby stars and an

atmosphere of stent planets. And

you will see that some of

these -- most of these first

images are photographs.

But we also have what is called

spectra, you take life and

spread it out, you can see all

of the separate colors.

In visible light, you can see

the rainbow.

We are talking about invisible

colors but a spectra allows

scientists to look at bright

colors with different patterns,

to show what properties are made

of.

We are trying to make this

accessible, not hoarding all of

the information.

Our news package -- what we have

on the screen, by the way,

sorry, we have four screenshots.

One of the home page, and

article about the Carina nebula,

the cosmic cliffs, the

star-forming region, a

screenshot of the article

written about it, a screenshot

of the caption to one of the

images and a screenshot to one

of the social media posts, we

had images, spectra, articles,

in-depth articles, what is this?

What did Webb see?

And a caption of the image going

into more detail about what is

there.

Social media, part of that to

get everybody excited very

quickly and come find out more

information.

All right, one extra component

here that we have for the first

images, it was this ALT text or

alternative text, text

descriptions of the images.

The images and spectra are a

really important component of

communicating the science, the

wonder, the excitement of the

Webb space telescope.

If you cannot access those

images for whatever reason, it's

not fair. We want to make sure

people can really get the most

out of this information.

And with all of the captions, we

wrote descriptions of the

images.

I have another screenshot of the

image of the Carina nebula, a

description of alt text, I will

not read, just letting you know

that it is there, and image

description that comes up on

social media, now we have image

descriptions and a description

from our thumbnail image, to

show you that we write different

types of descriptions, depending

on the purpose.

Okay, alt text is a

description -- you code it into

a field, sorry, developer

people, I'm not saying it right,

okay --

[Laughs]

Usually there is a limit on

that, a character limit, you can

only put so much information in

there.

But sometimes we need more

information.

We also wrote extended

descriptions because some of our

graphics are complicated.

What I have on the screen are

two graphics that are more

complicated, one that shows a

sliver of an image of lots of

galaxies and a pullout of one of

those galaxies so you can see it

up close.

And then a graph that shows

different elements that are in

that galaxy, which is crazy that

we can see that and it is 13.1,

light that was given off 13.1

billion years ago.

Yes, exactly, that's what we all

felt.

Yes.

Anyway, this is a pretty complex

graphic.

We have a long description here.

Another graphic we have over

here, I will go into more detail

on that one, it is what we call

a transmission spectrum.

It's a graph showing the

brightness of light on different

wavelengths and what molecules

are on this planet's atmosphere.

Great, okay, I'm going to talk a

little bit about the process we

went through to develop the text

descriptions. And the approach.

This is not a new thing, having

alt text, I do not know how long

it's been around, someone

probably does but we've always

had this and in our system and

on our web sites, it's a

requirement, you cannot publish

an image without it.

However, the way we are

approaching it is different.

At one time, we had a very

limited character count.

Maybe 60 characters or 120.

That is less than an old tweet,

right?

Oh, sorry, I am echoey.

It's not enough.

You can say oh, pretty picture

and that is pretty much all you

can say, right? It's not enough.

The other thing, we wanted to

make this part of our process,

not an afterthought.

Like oh, I've got to fill this

in.

We really wanted to make these

descriptions great.

We wanted to share this

excitement, these beautiful

images and spectra.

We did a lot of experimentation,

we worked with existing imagery

from Hubble and did a lot of

writing, reviewing each other's

writing, working with

consultants from the blind and

visually impaired community to

provide a lot of really

important feedback.

One time we met with them and I

read aloud a description I

wrote.

What do you think, does this

work?

They were able to provide

feedback like yes, I can imagine

that or no, that makes no sense.

That's really important.

We adjusted our technical

constraints and what I mean by

that is we took away -- we

increased the amount of space we

had for that alt text field to

1,000 characters or so.

That's pretty good, you know?

That's a pretty good number.

Thank you to the people who did

that.

And we began developing standard

styles and guidelines to make it

easier for us. A lot of times,

writing this stuff is about

making choices.

We spend a lot of time thinking

should I do it this way, this

way?

Make the choice, figure out how

to do it and then focus on the

content.

Approach.

Again, rather than doing alt

text descriptions later, this is

part of a news package now, it's

part of our writing.

We have our article, caption,

it's part of the whole thing.

We think -- really, we are

focusing on the audience needs

rather than being like oh, I

will check that off, you know, I

wrote and asked in that field

and now it's done.

That does happen and you might

come across things like that.

In other alt text, not ours.

We put the alt text descriptions

through a full editorial

process.

This is another important thing,

especially when talking about

science and technology imagery.

If you're talking about everyday

photos, a picture of a dog

playing with a ball, that is

pretty standard, right?

But some of these images, these

graphics are not familiar,

right?

They show crazy stuff, they are

complex.

We had to research, we had to

draft, these went through

subject matter experts, editors,

you know?

Accessibility experts.

We have one of our staff members

is visually impaired and he

reviewed stuff.

We make sure it goes through the

full editorial process and

that's really important.

You all are relying on this,

right?

It needs to be right and clear.

We want to treat it like any

other science communication.

Clear, doing its job.

Okay, sorry.

I'm just going to share with you

a few examples.

This one, what we have here --

oh, by the way, the previous

slide had text on it.

There were no pictures.

This slide, what we have here --

on the right, I'm going to read

to you what we have from the

text. I have it, written by one

of our writers here, Claire.

First of all, I'm going to read

this description and then I want

everyone to listen carefully and

then I will tell you -- Webb's

first deep field, SMACS 0723,

that is the title.

"Thousands of small galaxies

appear across this view.

Their colors of fairy.

Some are shades of orange, while

others are white.

Most appear as fuzzy ovals, but

a few have distinct spiral arms.

In front of the galaxies are

several foreground stars, most

appear blue, and the bright

stars have diffraction spikes.

Forming an 8-pointed star shape.

There are also many thin, long,

orange arcs that curve around

the center of the image."

There are two people at least,

maybe three in the audience that

are probably familiar with this

image because I see them with

jackets, this image on their

jackets.

[Laughs]

You can get images, by the way,

but I want to tell you something

about this, Claire can describe

this beautifully but she thought

about what the purpose of the

image was, how does it make you

feel, what is the image convey?

I want to give a shout out to

her because Claire found out at

the last minute that this image

was going to be unveiled by

President Biden.

While she is writing the

caption, oh, my god, no

pressure.

Right?

I think she did a beautiful job.

Okay, second story of alt text

development.

This image, the cosmic cliffs of

the Carina nebula.

This -- we were under a tight

time constraints.

We had a lot to do and we had to

get the stuff ready to be out,

July 12th was the day.

It wasn't going to change.

So I'm meeting with my

supervisor, hiding in the back

here.

I was like, we have so much to

do. He asked how he could help.

I have to write this alt text

but it's so beautiful, I don't

even know where to start, how

can I do this justice?

I don't even know what to do.

I am a writer, a science writer,

describing this?

Oh.

He said "let me take a shot,"

thank you.

Beautiful, what he came up with.

We did a little bit of editing

but I will tell you, and John is

a designer.

He's not a writer but he is a

writer -- he doesn't know that.

Okay, let me read this out loud,

this got a lot of press too.

"the image is divided

horizontally by an undulating

line between a cloud scape

forming a nebula along the

bottom portion and a

comparatively clear upper

portion.

Speckled across both portions as

a star field, showing

innumerable stars of many sizes.

The smallest of these are small,

distant, and faint points of

light.

The largest of these appear

larger, closer, brighter, and

were fully resolved with 8-point

diffraction spikes.

The upper portion of the images

bluish, and has wispy

translucent cloudlike streaks

rising from the nebula below.

The oranges cloudy formation in

the bottom half that varies in

density and ranges from

translucent to opaque. The stars

vary in color, the majority of

which, have a blue or orange

hue.

The cloudlike structure of the

nebula contains ridges, peaks,

and valleys, and appearance very

similar to a mountain range.

Three long diffraction spikes

from the top right edge of the

image suggest the presence of a

large star just out of view."

The third example I want to give

you is of an illustration.

And I'm sharing this one -- I

will describe it in a second.

I'm sharing this illustration to

tell you that writing these

descriptions does a lot for the

writer.

We do it for the audience but

the writer gets a lot out of it.

What I got out of this one was

that this image here shows --

it's an illustration,

illustrating the variety of

science that Webb can do.

The designer here is Liz.

When I first saw it, I was like

that is beautiful, gorgeous, I

will have a T-shirt and

bedspread of that.

But it was not until I started

describing it that I realized

how smart it is, right?

This is not just a pretty image,

it's meaningful.

I start writing about it.

Oh, my gosh, look at this.

Across the middle is a jagged

line.

That represents a spectrum.

She's got color gradation from

red on the left to purple on the

right and that is representative

of the spectrum too, the rainbow

spectrum. In the middle is a

hexagonal window, almost.

And within that hexagon are

illustrations of different space

objects.

We've got a planet, a spiral

galaxy, red dots to represent

distances to galaxies, something

shooting material out, I think

that is an active galactic

nucleus or a star, I don't know.

But it's exciting, right?

And we've got the 8-pointed

diffraction pattern for the

stars.

I am writing this and I'm like,

oh, my gosh, this is the most

awesome illustration of Webb

science.

So smart and beautiful.

I got a lot out of that.

I just needed to share that.

All right, so, let me just

check -- okay.

What we have here, images are

not the only thing we did.

We do a lot of complex graphics.

On this slide, I'm not going to

go into great detail except to

say that each one contains a

combination of images, maps,

graphs, they all are very rich

in information. They take a

while -- they are all

accessible, you can understand

but they take a while to think

about.

You have to spend some time with

them, right?

We needed to write long

descriptions of these to make

sure.

Part of our thing with Webb was

getting across the idea that

Webb is working well and telling

us a lot and it's rigorous,

right?

We aren't just making this stuff

up.

This is some heavy information

here. To do this, I'm going to

focus on -- sorry, how does this

work?

I'm going to focus on one of

these graphics. A transmission

spectrum of the exoplanet

WASP-96 b.

This is telling us that there is

water in this atmosphere, okay?

The graph has a lot of

information on it and we wanted

to figure out how to communicate

that.

One thing to know about alt text

for all of these scientists

thinking about how they're going

to do this, it's part of a

larger package.

These are just screenshots of

the article and the caption they

go with this image.

All easily accessible on a

screen reader.

We are filling a gap.

What is this graphic giving us

that we cannot get otherwise?

When we did this, again,

thinking about alt text from the

beginning, I was a writer on

this and I worked really closely

with a subject expert on here,

Nestor.

He reviewed my work and such so

I understood it completely.

But it requires a lot of

understanding of the graphical

representation, right? You have

to know about it to write the

alt text but you don't have to

do it on your own.

Here is the short alt text for

this.

"Graphic titled hot gas giant

exoplanet WASP-96 b atmosphere

opposition, single object

slitless spectroscopy," the

graphic shows the transmission

spectrum of the hot gas giant

exoplanet captured using Webb's

single-object slitless Spector's

copy with an illustration of the

planet and its star in the

background.

The data points are plotted on a

graph of amount of light blocked

in parts per million versus

wavelength of light in microns.

A curvy blue line represents a

best-fit model.

Four prominent peaks visible in

the data and model are labeled

"water, each two oh it does not

really get across the depth of

the data here. I'm not going to

read this description out loud

but what I will say, but we did

was we described the axes very

carefully, the rains, labels, we

describe the data, not to point

by point but enough that the

patterns are understandable. We

describe the air bars and how

they vary, how the model relates

to the data, how many data

points there are, 141, et

cetera, et cetera.

It's intended to communicate

that this is -- we have a lot of

data and it's really good.

And I can tell you a lot.

Okay, you might be thinking,

especially if you are a writer

or an astronomer, oh, my god,

that's so much work.

How my going to fit it in? Good

news, once you get a structure

or pattern for how you want to

describe things, you can

replicate that.

What I have on the screen are

four different graphics, I have

screenshots of the extended

descriptions.

Well, we now have very similar

graphics that we have been

creating for all of the new data

and we've basically used the

same template.

Like a fill in the blank, you

know? The X X axis shows this.

Just figuring out a good method

or good overall framework for

describing things, okay?

That's why I had this recycling

icon on here as well.

I am big into the reduce, reuse,

recycle.

With that in mind, just so you

guys no, we have these

screenshots, when we did these

projects, they were released as

accessible PDFs.

We now have -- you can click

somewhere and get the extended

description, the alt text, you

can use this, astronomers, you

can copy this, fill in the right

numbers so it's obvious you did

not just copy and paste, right?

This is free to use, all public

domain, okay? You're not

cheating by doing that.

Okay, the response, first images

of spectra from Webb went all

around the world, like, pretty

much everywhere.

I think there were more than

20,000 articles. Our

spreadsheet broke.

Excel wouldn't go that far.

What I have on the screen are a

bunch of front pages showing the

images all in different -- we

have some in English and some in

German, I don't know Japanese,

images of the Carina nebula, the

southern ring, all around the

world.

This was wonderful.

But...

What was perhaps more exciting,

because it was so unexpected,

was the response we got about

the alt text.

We wrote this alt text in

extended description because we

knew it was important.

We wanted to.

We didn't really have any

concept -- I think some of us

knew statistically, oh, there's

this many people who could use

this.

But I did not -- personally

speaking -- I don't think I had

a real understanding of who this

was benefiting.

Suddenly, Twitter kind of

"exploded," if that is the

Twittery word for it, people

were talking about it.

I mean, look at this.

This is just lovely. These are

screenshots of articles and

tweets and stuff about the alt

text, okay? The unexpected star

of NASA's images, et cetera.

The tweets were the ones that I

think got it started, sharing it

out and connecting us with our

audience, right?

As a blind person who has had

dreams of doing astronomy since

I was six, thank you to whoever

not only remembered to write alt

text for this but did so in such

a beautiful way.

I will likely never know who you

are but you touched my heart on

this day, alt text writer good

doesn't that give you chills?

This is Claire's text here,

previewed by POTUS.

If someone ever tells you that

alt text isn't important, show

them NASA's alt text for the

Webb telescope.

They are able to convey the

wonders and beauty in their

words, making these breathtaking

views accessible.

If that's not the most wonderful

feedback, whenever I'm feeling

down, I just look at this slide.

What I wanted to say about the

impact of this, it's not just

that it makes us feel good, this

had an enormous impact on the

way we are doing our work and

what I mean by that is when this

happens, suddenly we were like,

we want to do it -- we knew it

was important.

It wasn't like we were going to

just stop doing it but suddenly,

all of us, oh, my gosh, you can

imagine our audience, they need

it and want it.

We will write it even better. We

will make sure everything we're

doing has it, going back into

our archives, we have people

focused on this, a summer intern

coming in, working on the Hubble

all text, that is 33 years worth

of stuff, right? That's had a

great impact.

What I hope and what I think

it's happening, other

organizations are seeing it and

being like, maybe we should

start doing this?

I'm feeling left out of the

party here.

It's pretty fun.

Okay, 11:30, great.

I will give you top tips, does

that sound good?

None of us -- I don't have a PhD

in accessibility but I do have a

lot of experience on this

project.

I'm going to share -- our

writers do too.

We worked on a style guide, what

are some good practices, ways

you can approach? A lot of

times, it's a little bit

intimidating.

One of the ironic things is,

having done such a good job,

that can also make it feel

intimidating to people.

How can I ever write something

that great?

Or how could I do it in this

way?

Anyway, first of all, you've got

to think about the purpose of

the image, is it there to convey

that information or give a

visual cue?

Identify your constraints, often

times, you might have technical

constraints.

This is, like many other types

of writing -- one thing to

remind yourself, describing

visual scenes.

All the radio and podcasts, all

description just using words.

When you think of it like that,

I can lift some of the anxiety

off of you, right?

Another thing, simple alt text

is better than no alt text, you

want it to be accurate.

Try not to stress too much if

you don't have time or not sure

what to do.

This circular shaped region, et

cetera, I find it useful to get

the big picture first and then

zoom in on the details.

Sometimes it's harder to orient

because people have to do that,

okay, how did that fit together

in their head?

Separately?

Include relevant details. By

that, obviously an image -- if

you have 1,000 pixels, there is

a thousand pieces of information

there.

Plus, all of the relationships.

Include relevant details.

Science stuff, connect it to the

science.

Here's a picture and it has a

horizontal, cylindrical black

shape and four cylinders

descending down vertically from

that central cylinder and you

are like, oh, my gosh, what?

I could have just said "it's a

picture of a dog," okay? Similar

in science.

You might want to say that it's

a picture of a planetary nebula

and then describe it so those

that know what a planetary

nebula look like can immediately

imagine.

Be careful about misconceptions.

That can be hard.

That's one reason why you want

other people reviewing it.

And also remember that the

reader -- you don't have to do

everything. If you are stuck,

ask John, he will write it for

you.

[Laughs]

Okay, pretend you are on the

phone.

In fact, get on the phone, call

up your mom and be like "let me

just described this to you," it

works. I have done that.

Pretend you are describing it to

an artist over the phone who has

to create the rich for you.

Don't worry about the length to

start.

I like to write a lot.

I write it all and then I cut

back.

That's one strategy.

Another one that works well,

look with your eyes, not your

brain.

What they mean by that is if you

know what something is, you

might take shortcuts into

explaining something, shortcuts

that are not useful to the

audience, right? Take yourself

out of the image and describe

it.

Quality assurance. This is an

important thing. Okay, give it

to someone who hasn't seen the

image. This works really well.

In fact, the other day, I sent

it to somebody -- our news chief

and she was like "it looks fine

but you got left and right mixed

up."

I do this a lot. She knew it

because she read the

description, try to imagine in

her head and then looked at it.

Oh, I imagined this.

So.

By the way, for you all who are

not seeing the screen, I have

these tips on the screen. A

visual describing.

It's just spot art.

Definitely, if you are not an

expert on the subject matter,

have a subject matter expert

review it.

When you are writing for new

images, wait until your image is

almost done -- in the alt text,

right -- we come across errors

because you are looking at it

with a very close eye, I'm going

to go real quick here.

Efficiency, make templates,

modify existing, make yourself a

style guide, that kind of thing.

Let's see, okay, final thing I

wanted to say.

First of all, this is the image

I got, the James Webb space

telescope illustration. The same

illustration before, just so you

know, none of our very talented

designers were involved in this

kindergarten cut and paste of

Webb images.

[Laughs]

Telescope and many scientific

instruments are accessibility

tools.

A telescope shows a slight that

is too dim, too far away, small,

for anybody, any human eye to

see.

Now it Webb and a lot of other

telescopes show us forms of

light that no human eyes can

detect.

Webb is detecting infrared

light, Hubble looks at visible

and ultraviolet light, and there

are lots of other telescopes.

They are collecting and helping

us analyze light that no one can

see without these tools.

So this is just a demonstration

here.

What I have are three different

views of the pillars of

creation, on the left is what

our eyes would see in this

infrared, nothing. In the

middle, a translation, showing

some of the light that Webb can

detect, one color, so to speak.

And on the right is a full-color

composite image.

Part of our work is translating

this into full-color images,

invisible light into visible

color images.

And then one extra step on the

road to making this all

accessible.

So, thank you!

I don't have any time for

questions, but...

[Laughs]

</p><p> Jen: Thank you so much.

We are going to take a break,

step out if needed. If anyone

wanted to ask questions during

the break, okay, let's take 5

minutes to do questions but also

feel free to leave. What's your

question?

</p><p> A question from Adrienne.

For very long alt text, being a

barrier to quick understanding,

some best practice guides have

strict caps on character count,

often 100 characters, less than

a tweet, while others disagree.

What was your thought process

with navigating this wide range

of advice?

</p><p> Margaret: Thanks.

That's a really good point.

I cannot speak to the technical

assets here.

Previous guidance -- shorter is

better.

That's certainly the case in

some cases. It certainly depends

on the context, for something

like a thumbnail image, 50

images on a screen and you are

trying to quickly navigate

through then, I'm guessing just

like the thumbnail is tiny, it's

give you an idea of what is

there.

The alt text is very simple. It

would just say image of a

planet, galaxy, that kind of

thing, when you're describing

something in detail, I know and

Tim can probably speak a little

bit more to this, a lot of

people use their screen readers

very fast and they can navigate

that information very quickly.

We also use navigational -- for

the extended descriptions, you

can use headers and that type of

thing so you can skip around. We

definitely begin with the

overview statement so you know

immediately what this is and you

know, do I want to go into the

detail?

If nothing else, do I listen for

a second, do I know what this

is?

Then I can decide if I want to

go into detail. My personal

feeling, if it's not there, it's

not accessible at all, to

anybody. I don't know if that's

helping answer the question.

</p><p> Jen: We have a question in

person.

</p><p> Hi.

What changes in your approach --

</p><p> Patrick: Can you say your

name?

</p><p> Kyle.

What changes in your approach

for writing alt text subject

matter experts and to the

general public, what are some of

the variables that shift in how

you write such alt text?

</p><p> Margaret: Like your audience

is a subject matter expert?

Yeah, I think it's similar to

any other type of content, you

can take shortcuts with

terminology, certainly.

You would want to, depending on

the audience, what they are

going to use it for, more

detail.

If you've got a graph because

you need people to use it,

you're going to want to go into

detail.

One of the things we can do with

graphs is provide a CSV file, a

file of data so people can use

that in different ways and make

it accessible in other ways, I'm

not an expert on that.

Some people can put it on a

tactile reader.

Thank you, Josh is nodding.

One of the strategies I use, I

try to imagine if my Internet

went down and I have a low

bandwidth, will do I know or

what do I need to know to

properly access this

information?

</p><p> Patrick: Any other questions

in the room, raise your hand.

Oh, a question right over here.

Microphone.

</p><p> Thank you.

Would you like me to share the

way I personally think --

another good way to write alt

text from a blind perspective

would be?

</p><p> Margaret: Absolutely.

That would be wonderful, thank

you.

</p><p> No problem.

There are a few steps to this.

Before you actually write the

caption, picture the photo in

your mind with your eyes closed.

From there, right the alt text.

It can be confusing with left

and right, I know that.

</p><p> Margaret: Yes.

[Laughs]

</p><p> And then just reread it a few

times, do I need to change it?

Just read it a few times before

actually taking your next steps.

</p><p> Margaret: That's really

helpful, thank you.

My last slide here, I have

questions, comments, and

suggestions.

If you have or have any

feedback, we want it, we want to

hear what is working and not

working.

.

</p><p> Any other questions,

comments, or suggestions from

the room?

Over here?

</p><p> What are some difficulties

you had that prompted you to

make this better?

</p><p> Margaret: We just recognized

it was not sufficient, you know?

That was one part of a big, big

project, to make things more

accessible. We just realized we

were not able to convey the

imagery and the graphics very

well.

</p><p> Patrick: I think there was

one more, and then we will

break.

</p><p> Do you ever write it down on

physical paper before you write

it online? I know with all kinds

of writing, people do that, did

you do that?

</p><p> Margaret: Some of us do. In

fact, yes, we do write on paper

before we write online.

Yeah.

</p><p> Patrick: I think we need to

take a break.

Some questions in the front row?

One more round of applause.

[Applause]

</p><p> Margaret: Thank you so much!

</p><p> Jen: We have 5 minutes until

the next talk and then feel free

to get up and get back in here

right at noon.
