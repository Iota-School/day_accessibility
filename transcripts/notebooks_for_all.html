<p> Isabela: Hello!

</p><p> Tony: Is this working? Do I

need to bring it closer to my

face?

We are good. Cool.

</p><p> Isabela: Awesome.

I will be starting us off.

That's good.

</p><p> Tony: Hey, Jen, thank you for

having us here.

</p><p> Isabela: The gratitude is

really necessary pair this will

take a lot of people and

expertise.

I value you being here.

</p><p> Jennifer: I'm having trouble

finding the document for the

presentation.

maybe it is on the Webex.

</p><p> Tony: Great!

</p><p> Isabela: Wonderful.

Can resume that in a little bit?

</p><p> Tony: Thank you, Jen.

</p><p> Isabela: You should have

access to this document,

resources for you in the future

pair that's one thing I would

add.

Shared more about the project

than I expected.

Nonetheless, I'm super excited

to talk to you about the

Notebooks for All project, which

includes this event but it's not

the limits of this event.

We will talk more about what

we've been doing to better

understand problems within

notebook accessibility issues,

what kind of remediation we've

been doing, fixes, where we are

going in the future without.

First, I know we were

introduced, my name is Isabela

Presedo-Floyd, I use she/her

pronouns, I look like out of a

fluffy dog atop my head at all

times.

Thank you, I appreciate that. In

terms of what I do on this

project, I spend most of my time

on the user research section,

how will be set up these tests,

what are we going to do?

I'm here with Tony, he/they

pronouns, a much larger dog than

me.

Under the hat, equally poofy.

He handles a lot of our

open-source expertise.

He's really fantastic at it.

Those are the perspectives will

be talking from.

Other people on the team include

Jen and Patrick and Eric, who is

in the audience. I don't know if

we will hear from him today. A

really awesome team with a lot

of different skills.

I will hand it over to Tony to

explain a little more about

space, maybe?

</p><p> Tony: Thank you so much.

That was a great intro.

Thank you so much, Isabela.

I kind of wanted to think about

this in the scale of space here.

There are trillions of galaxies

out there. At least, that's what

Google told me.

I'm not an expert out there.

Billions of devices, more

important on the software side

for us.

Recently, there are millions of

notebooks.

This concept of a notebook, a

scientific document is growing

on our social network for code,

Github, growing at the scale of

thousands.

But there is a significant scale

that we are trying to address in

this very small project.

</p><p> Isabela: A lot of these

notebooks are shared through so

many different disciplines.

Neither one of us are

astronomers here today.

But tons of languages, both

spoken language, coding

language, documents that are

cutting across all of these

different things.

When they are inaccessible, this

is not a small impact.

We don't want anything to be

inaccessible, I would say.

This is impacting more people

than we can accurately count

right now.

Our smallest picture, for the

scope of this project is

actually the notebook file

itself. For those of you

familiar with Jupyter, I'm

talking about the file, not the

notebook that is an interface.

You can't hear the

capitalization in my voice.

What notebook is she talking

about?

Yeah, in this case, we have a

circular flow chart. That's what

happens when you're staring at a

bunch of people and forgetting

words, that has three boxes in

it.

Design on the lower left, if you

go up and center, development,

lower right is testing. They all

connect in a circle.

That's the cycle we were working

with for this project. We have

different expertise, trying to

cycle through, what do we have

with Jupyter right now and what

we want with it Jupyter?

Take it to the designer, how do

we want to test this and how do

we get that information to

development?

Going back and forth.

Retesting those changes we had

in the cycle.

Of course, that sounds much more

straightforward when I say it to

you like that, cycles and

practice are much messier.

Those were the things we were

focusing on, highlighting all of

the different skills from those

different people and creating a

process that we could validate

that these changes were helping

people and centering feedback

from actual disabled people

instead of discussing what was

going to work well and not.

Tony is going to talk to

everyone a little bit more about

notebooks.

</p><p> Tony: The only way I can do

this is if I can yell. I have to

cram a lot into very little.

I'm going to be careful with

everybody's ears here.

Notebooks, right?

Most people are familiar with

the physical concept of a

notebook where you write some

stuff or draw some pretty

pictures.

That's exactly what scientists

are doing.

But they have an interface for

it.

It's not words, it something

more than words, we have word

processing documents that allow

you to put computation in them.

It changes the way that we can

see and explore the world.

These notebooks are designed to

combine code and narrative.

Code becoming so much more

popular, we need everybody to

understand how to talk about the

two, writing code is a

privilege.

But software literacy should be

accessible to everybody.

That is our major concern here.

These notebooks have a concept

of them, of cells, take a bunch

of cells and put them together,

they can do magical things

together. These cells contain

these notes, narratives, people

can put them together and tell

their stories in really novel

ways in a data-driven world.

This technology is affecting

millions and millions of data

scientists and students,

providers with Jupyter, Google,

Microsoft, so on and so forth,

they are used in documentation,

testing, classrooms, the

platform is consistently

inaccessible across all things.

As our user base grows, the

number of people being excluded

by this technology grow. We are

trying to figure out in this

Notebooks for All problem what

makes an accessible

computational document so that

people can participate in the

code world?

I think that's your part, about

getting people to participate.

</p><p> Isabela: Is it?

Sure.

</p><p> Tony: Indeed!

</p><p> Isabela: Are we talking about

participating with our user

testing?

</p><p> Tony: You are doing user

design and you brought all of

these people in.

</p><p> Isabela: This project has

been years in the making,

believe it or not.

I'm so excited to be here, that

this work is being done.

All of us across different

organizations, we are working

together. There's a public

Jupyter accessibility call.

It took a few years, I think.

But we figured out how to work

together.

It's been really awesome.

That's part of why we have such

a mixed group of people working

on the project and what made it

possible, we all had different

resources we were able to work

with to actually get paid to

user testing, which has been

something we were all aiming for

but really only able to do

together.

That's been really awesome.

Another aspect of that is that

we wanted to make all of this

public.

That also means for those of you

less aware with open sores,

everything we are working on,

code and design assets -- anyone

can use and reuse as you see fit

with open source.

Getting participation hopefully

from other people in the future.

We want this resource to be

useful to you.

</p><p> Tony: Yes, indeed. Every

single thing you mentioned

includes a round of advocacy by

advocating compensation, this

work, you continue to do it.

It's fabulous.

One of the things that is

hard -- we live in this notebook

world, this concept of a

notebook.

We wanted a better analogy to

bring what we are trying to work

on here. The situation for us

and for data scientists using

Jupyter who have been the main

clients we've had, they want

everything.

They want to fill their house

with everything, now, if you try

to move around the house, it's

completely inaccessible.

That's the place we got to. We

have a lot of stuff and we don't

know how to make it accessible.

Some of the steps, some of the

approaches and analogies we

wanted to hear, how do we

perceive a notebook as a house?

If you use this for a classroom

and people are together for an

hour in the same space, this

notebook can transform space and

allow people to collaborate.

These cells are rooms. When we

started to do this and we were

thinking about this house

analogy, retrofitting

accessibility is...

A risk.

It's an attrition problem.

Either you have the resources to

do it or you do not.

We kind of found ourselves on

that cusp.

We are going to talk about what

it was like trying to retrofit

and understand what we have and

what our new house might look

like based on standards.

Tell us about inviting people

into our new house, full of

stuff.

</p><p> Isabela: Inviting people in

is the user testing.

We need activity -- we want you

to come test this and complain,

essentially. Tell us what is

working, what isn't, that's kind

of the process we are going

through here.

The image on this page is a list

of GitHub issues, part of the

user testing was writing up

these issues so even if we do

not get to fix them all, because

there's more than we have time

for but this project, that they

are all documented now.

Both the problems that we had

and, in many cases, solutions we

had discussed.

Making sure this work does not

get lost.

It is documented somewhere.

And we have these concrete

issues but we also have larger

takeaways.

Perhaps some of the most

interesting ones to me.

Many of them kind of applied to

more places than I thought.

There is a link to the

navigation test results, can you

get year, can you do this?

To get to this place on the

notebook?

I'm currently writing up once,

to actually work on this event.

That is a draft, sorry. I have

some takeaways, we were testing

when you have a notebook

basically stuffed with all of

this stuff.

Existing space telescope

notebooks we were able to test

in as well.

Real things people wanted to put

in the notebook. Many of the

fixes, people involved in

accessibility work would

consider the basics. A lot of

the issues, there is no label.

I have no idea what I'm doing

here. There's no way -- no

heading structure that makes

sense.

Those are very fixable. We know

how to fix those things.

Really anyone authoring a

notebook can fix them on their

own.

Users really rely on

familiarity.

Some of them were like oh, I

know what a notebook is.

Some people had no idea what a

notebook was but the no the

code.

If they know the code, they can

backtrack.

But figuring out what their

expectations are, and the

annoying but normal -- the

best-case scenario we ever got,

oh, yeah, I hate the way that

works but I hate the way that

works everywhere on the

Internet.

Like that's not really your

problem.

But that was interesting, Jen

and I leaned into that.

What could we do instead?

Maybe we can start figuring out

these things.

That's your preview.

I'm pretty sure I'm handing it

back to Tony, though.

</p><p> Tony: That's great.

What could it be instead?

Standard spaced, for any

accessibility experts in the

room or attending, every single

notebook interface has a form,

multiple forms.

Each cell has a form in it.

If I have 20 cells, I have 20

forms, not a single one of them

have a submit button on any of

the projects, anywhere.

Massive failure.

It started looking like yeah, we

got to this technology out of

need but the -- what is the

meaning of this thing?

This is actually a form.

We could not have gotten to the

sort of things if we didn't have

the feedback from people's

experiences and listen and

interpret the results.

The way that Jen and Isabela

shared their work in an

open-source way, it's super

exemplary.

User testing really benefited

us.

Another thing that benefited us,

the community.

Shout out again to Jen and

Patrick for organizing the

hackathon, having these advocacy

events.

Learning that we have this

house.

But it's part of a community,

right?

Part of community advocacy. We

appreciate you all being here.

Yeah.

</p><p> Isabela: I think we have 2

minutes.

</p><p> Tony: Oh, we started late?

Okay, cool.

Getting the house up to code.

This is my favorite part. A

short period of time to condense

down hundreds of hours of work.

Basically what we started with

was making fixes to the existing

situation and I lost my hammer

and I started using my head for

the nails instead.

I was like, there has to be a

better way.

For guidelines, there are core

principles and accessibility, we

have something more.

We do not have a banking

application, we have this

malleable object.

We need to add more principles,

it needs to be compromising,

assistive and flexible.

We cannot provide -- we have to

clean up everything here.

These notebooks become documents

when we see them especially in

the browser and they contain

metadata. We started trying to

apply analogies. I need a table

in my house to have people over

for dinner.

One of the notebooks that we had

from the space telescope folks

had 80 cells in it.

That's a lot of rooms in a

house, a big McMansion.

I need a lot of tables, need to

navigate this place. By going

toward HTML 5, a modern standard

for the web, we can comply with

more accessibility features, if

we obey the semantics right and

stop having opinions as

scientists and let designers

have opinions as designers, I

promise everybody is going to do

more of what they are good at.

</p><p> Isabela: Opinions --

</p><p> Tony: This project is an

example of it, the

interdisciplinary things

happening at the Space Telescope

Science Institute.

I can't wait for the alt text

talk. I'm not going to show a

demo because we are lacking on

time but how do you navigate

these things?

They are very unwieldy.

But they look better on a screen

reader, we are considering the

legibility of it, proposing

things like dyslexic font.

Using code, highlighting

syntaxes for colorblindness.

And there's a table of contents.

I was going to party but they're

a bunch of links here.

Check out some of the notebooks

that we tested.

There are links in this

presentation here.

This is an example of one of the

notebooks, give a quick rip

through it.

</p><p> Isabela: This is not how it

looks now, by the way.

</p><p> Tony: But a better future, a

better visual experience.

Check out these on your own.

Some of the things we used while

we were working on this, screen

readers, dev tools, equal access

checker, standards and

heuristics.

</p><p> Isabela: It's important to

know what we did not get to come

out the next questions we want

to answer, one of the big

things, we worked with a small

sample and it ended up being

very visual-focused.

We got a wide variety but I

think that's important to note,

there's a lot of research we

could be doing there.

We really focused on navigation

and reading experiences.

We didn't talk about the editing

experience at all. That's

another big problem and we

wanted to make sure we could

center on things, reading is

also necessary to advocate -- it

felt a little bit like a

precursor.

People can put almost anything

in notebooks.

The reason I bring that end, we

tested on existing notebooks,

things that people are really

using but every day, I see

people show up with the new

things in notebooks that have

never seen before.

Awesome in one sense but keep in

mind, if you are one of those

people writing notebooks, give

it a try with something.

See what you can do to check its

accessibility, a longer

discussion. The retrofitting is

difficult. A lot of cases where

we were hitting their heads

against walls, figuring out what

to do with the existing product

rather than starting from

scratch has been an experience.

It has felt like a lot of things

from the outside.

We are obviously going over

time. That is evidenced in

our --

</p><p> Tony: Wait, what?

You said we had 20 minutes.

Okay, cool.

We will leave some room for

questions.

</p><p> Isabela: That's probably my

fault, not doing math right.

I have not had to take a math

class in many years.

</p><p> Tony: That's what notebooks

are for.

</p><p> Isabela: No.

The math still needs to be done

right. But a lot of what we've

already discussed but to

reiterate, I cannot tell you how

many accessibility projects have

been on where this has been a

struggle to make this happen --

it's sometimes tricky with

Jupyter because we know it'll be

inhospitable.

We are inviting people to a

house that is not up to code in

many cases and we are just kind

of holding it together.

We've also found a lot of

patterns across all of these

notebooks.

Things become a lot clearer.

A lot of things that I didn't

see before, kind of what I was

talking about earlier with some

of those annoying but normal,

all of those kind of things,

just kept coming up.

Even with our limited sample and

budget.

Fighting that technical debt --

oh, every time we think we get a

little closer, I think that

resonates with people.

It feels like two steps back

some dates.

Having resources for open user

testing -- if anyone is

interested in that, I would love

to walk you through those

resources and see what you can

repurpose for yourself, what

kind of testing structures do we

have for you?

All of the open resources.

Tony has also been producing

things that I know less about

how to explain it well.

I'm just really excited to see

this process not only happen but

for us to be able to document it

so people can carry it on.

The work is not done. I don't

want to send that message at

all. You want to wrap up with

that one?

</p><p> Tony: I just want to

highlight how remarkable it is,

what a small interdisciplinary

and inclusive team accomplished

in such a short period of time

on very limited resources, it's

challenging these spaces, which

need more resources.

We appreciate your advocacy and

support in all of this stuff.

Shout out to the team. I did not

think we would get here. It

seemed ambitious.

We are at a good place and it

would not have happened if a lot

of special people did not get

together.

Isabela and I have been working

together for...

Four, five years?

</p><p> Isabela: We from working with

each other a lot for, like,

three.

</p><p> Tony: We've never been able

to give this presentation

together.

Thank you.

Hey.

</p><p> Isabela: How do we want to

take questions?

I wasn't expecting that.

I should also say, I do a lot of

remote work.

I'm not used to giving these

talks in person.

I'm used to staring at a chat

silently for a few moments.

</p><p> This is a question for

Isabela.

I'm sure that you can talk about

this at length but I wanted to

hear a little bit more about the

modes of user testing that you

use and what you've found most

valuable, if there is anything

that brought out any particular

surprises?

</p><p> Isabela: We really only used

two methods.

It was usability testing, which

means we create a script -- I'm

using that word loosely.

A list of tasks we are going to

ask people to do.

In many cases, specific about

the way we are asking it too. If

we ask them to find this sell by

number, by heading, thinking of

those ways, that's the main

design but we've also had these

user interviews at the end as

well, those are not completing

tasks, in many cases, we do it

as a reflection at the end, what

happened, what did you expect?

Those were the main two methods,

mentioned in the write ups.

If those terms aren't familiar

with you, you might have to give

it a quick look up. I'm trying

to see if there's anything I

want to say about that.

Was that helpful?

</p><p> Tony: Isabela has her scripts

on our documentation so you can

find links.

The script and results. And some

work in between is reproducible.

</p><p> Isabela: Tony is showing an

image for the documentation,

which is linked in the markdown

document that we shared.

This is a write up that

describes -- some more details

about what the participants were

using, what versions of things,

if that's helpful to you as

well.

Thank you for asking.

</p><p> You may have just answered my

question.

I was interested where you put

the overlap guidelines.

Were they under accessibility

tips?

</p><p> Tony: We haven't completed

those yet.

</p><p> Isabela: Like a mapping, one

to one?

</p><p> No, where the guidelines are.

</p><p> Tony: All of the stuff, the

content is in the GitHub repo.

We have a document describing

different things.

Again, everything is a work in

progress.

These will inform you about some

of the different states of the

notebook in ways that we talk

about the notebook in

accessibility tips and how you

can publish and there is an

authoring -- the formatting, I'm

sorry, aww.

</p><p> Isabela: Yes, they all exist

here.

I can show you specifically

where in the documentation as

well.

That's the main place where they

live right now, on GitHub.

</p><p> Patrick: If you have a

question, raise your hand and I

will bring the microphone to

you.

</p><p> This is a new thing for me

and it is fascinating.

My question, if I were to do

this and get involved, having a

lot of really good examples

would be wonderful.

It is part of your effort

getting people together to

create new notebooks from

scratch that are following these

best practices?

Very deliberate, people that are

invested and interested and all

that?

To have that kind of come alike,

critical mass of examples for

people to work from?

</p><p> Isabela: Fantastic question.

I realistically don't think we

will have the time in this

project to create new notebooks

come at the main thing we've

been looking at doing, updating

existing space telescopes,

following those kind of

guidelines.

But that's a dream I want.

I just know we have some more

things we need to wrap up in

terms of what we've promised

since that was not something we

initially thought we were going

to find.

We were not looking specifically

for authoring recommendations.

But doing all of this navigation

and content testing, we got a

lot of feedback for those were

actually things the authors

could do.

We expected to find things that

would require development fixing

and we really ended up finding

that that's a big thing.

But there's a lot of things

authors are doing that would

make a big difference as well,

headings is an author twice.

The developer cannot help you

use good headings, right?

At the moment, no, I don't have

"this is a beautiful paragon of

a notebook" type thing but

that's what the checklist is

starting to be.

It's pretty long, I will say

that.

That's something I hope to have

in the future.

If anyone is interested in that,

talk to us because I would be

interested in making that

happen.

</p><p> Tony: That is my stretch goal

for the project but I'm not very

limber.

</p><p> I </p><p> Patrick: Are there other

questions?

</p><p> Hey, I'm proud to say I'm one

of the user testers.

I don't know if I'm allowed to

say that but it's one of the

best experiences I have had.

I don't know if Jen agrees with

that because I was deafly the

person saying what are we doing

this for?

Why are there no headings?

It was a good experience for me

because I'm an analyst for the

federal government and we use

Jupyter Notebooks all the time.

My colleagues use it because I

cannot use it, I should say.

This is one of the reasons why I

wanted to help. I don't really

have a question but I want

people, as many people as

possible, to participate.

You are not only helping Space

Telescope Science Institute but

blind people everywhere like me

or analysts or people that want

to become analysts, it's one

thing to understand the data but

if you can I've been read what

your colleagues are reading and

you can't edit or write

notebooks?

It sets your career back and

it's really frustrating. I'm

happy to participate in the user

testing and I think it was a

great experience and everyone

did a great job.

I want to plug in everyone that

was able to do that.

</p><p> Tony: Thank you, Beth.

</p><p> Isabela: Thank you so much.

</p><p> I have one question for you,

can you slowly navigate to that

accessible -- the accessibility

tips for creating and

publishing?

Because...

They will be interested in those

links.

</p><p> Tony: I'm going to do this on

GitHub instead because it is

more predictable. If you go to

our link, it should be scattered

in certain places for the event.

Which one?

Resources?

Notebook authoring checklist.

If you are at the top of the

repository, you can also search

for it -- there is no search

unless you are signed in.

Resources, hackathon, event.

You will find the checklist.

Thank you.

</p><p> Jen: Thank you so much.

That was really fun to watch.

We are going to take a 12-minute

break, if we could all get back

here at 11:00, get some coffee,

go to the bathroom, we will have

more people entering.

See you at 11:00!
