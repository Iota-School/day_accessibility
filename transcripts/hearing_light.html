    <p> Hello I'm just letting people

      know they were gonna take a few

      more minutes just to let people

      to come back from lunch will be

      starting soon.

    </p><p> Welcome back from lunch I

      hope you're enjoying the food.

      So next up we are welcoming Dr.

      Scott Fleming. Scott works here

      at the science Institute, and he

      leads the branch that builds

      data search forms for all the

      different space telescopes that

      we hold.

      Like capillaries and such.

      He also needs a certification

      software process called us on a

      five.

      So he's going to explain what is

      data certification.

      And how we can certify astronomy

      data in a band or be an

      interactive game show where you

      will test your listening skills

      with certifications made from

      ask actual telescope data so

      please give a warm welcome to

      Scott.

    </p><p> I think thank you everyone.

      How is my volume?

      Good on the run? Thank you

      everyone.

      And I'm pleased to get this

      presentation about our work on

      Sonification. A nominee Jan

      would be doing this with me

      because she's one of the core

      members but she's busy today so

      I am flying solo but it is a

      good project so really quick,

      especially for people online

      this is certification.

      I will be playing sounds that

      are not coming from my own

      mouth.

      This is Sonification after all,

      so if you are online, you may

      want to plug in some headphones

      if you haven't been doing that

      just figured that good sound

      quality.

      And if you do a reminder to make

      sure that you plug in the device

      and you make sure you the device

      you want to use is connected to

      your headphone.

      So the agenda for the

      presentation at our first tell

      you what Sonification is.

      I will then motivate some of the

      reasons why we want to use

      Sonification in research

      including astronomy, I would do

      a brief introduction to the tool

      itself that we are creating

      called Astronify, there are

      other people doing this quite a

      lot actually but I will talk

      about our own participation.

      Then we will start doing our own

      example using real telescope

      data with real alien planets

      orbiting other stars in using

      sound to interpret the data.

      And then I will play some

      additional sounds in your job

      will be too able to count how

      many times that pregnant might

      have cross the surface of a

      star.

      Let's see how good we do.

      As the outline for the

      presentation.

      So I will start off by

      explaining what Sonification is.

      They were going to do it by

      telling you what it is not.

      What it is not is sounds that

      are produced in nature.

      Where the sound is the data.

      So what I'm currently showing on

      the screen right now the upper

      left is a picture of a tube on a

      tripod sitting at the bottom of

      the ocean.

      It's called a hydrophone, and

      the ocean scientist use this to

      record sound and sound travels

      really well in water and they

      can contact things are many

      away.

      And they are recording sounds to

      study our client of things like

      geology events animals like

      whales and the qualms they make.

      And earthquakes under this

      event.

      But in this case, the sound

      itself is the data that

      researchers are gathering.

      So this is not Sonification.

      Closer to home, another great

      example is a beautiful spring

      day outside today when you open

      your window hopefully you hear

      birds when you do. Birds are

      another example of where the

      sound itself is the data.

      The bird sounds are not

      Sonification.

      And on the upper left I have a

      picture for researchers in the

      field and their holding various

      recording devices because the

      data they are gathering is sound

      itself.

      Doesn't make sense everyone?

      Good.

      So then what is Sonification

      Scott?

      Sonification is using sound to

      represent other data.

      Most of us are familiar with the

      perfect example of this.

      If I show you a picture of this

      United States, and I colored it

      red and blue and yellow and

      orange, and I asked you what

      part of the country is hot today

      without telling you the numbers,

      both of you will be able to give

      me the right answer because we

      are used to seeing Carlos used

      to represent temperatures.

      An it's on things like weather

      maps.

      This is an example of when our

      television people have been

      better to use colors to

      represent pieces of data.

      Temperatures for example.

      Now, you can also, and you

      should, but we don't do enough,

      use other things to represent

      the temperature nuggets

      including sound.

      So for example you can imagine a

      map of the United States that

      has colors like red down in

      Florida, and then blue worm firm

      in New England, and also when

      you move your mouse or finger

      over it it will play a sound.

      Mayville play really

      high-pitched sound when it's

      hot, or low pitch sound when

      it's cold.

      You're using sound the way you

      use color to represent

      temperature in this case.

      And you're making it more

      accessible because people who

      are color-blind cannot see it

      all in this color map would be

      useless to them.

      But the sun would be better.

      And if you can experience that

      you give reinforced things.

      It's red and also high-pitched

      that means it's hot.

      I also know that red is hot

      because what I hear high-pitched

      it's right.

      When it comes to accessibility,

      the answer is always do more

      things together. It's always

      done.

      so that is what Sonification is.

      Hopefully that makes sense to

      you all.

      So there's a couple of reasons

      why we want to use this, first

      and foremost the human ear is

      actually better architecting

      small changes in the ice.

      A typical human ear can

      distinguish over 1,000

      frequencies of song and you are

      sensitive to changes at the

      microsecond level.

      So, that is 11 millionth of a

      second people are sensing things

      with their ears. Whether you

      appreciate it or not.

      The human eye is on the other

      hand are limited to about a

      hundred -- the changes 11 in a

      hundred.

      And this is the reasons why

      television and monitor companies

      are not making thousand frames

      per second in a million frames

      per second monitors.

      It's too expensive and you often

      they don't need it despite the

      Vita gators like think screen.

      Your eyes are simply not

      sensitive to changes much faster

      than a change in your ears.

      The ears, they are very

      sensitive to detecting change.

      In astronomy like a many

      scientist things are changing a

      very interesting.

      Another example of complexity

      data.

      What I'm sharing right now on

      the screen is a chart or a grid

      of graph paper and a simple

      example would be to say hey I

      want to measure the age of the

      baby as it grows.

      So, I would like to measure

      every month how much it weighs,

      make sure it's going in a

      healthy way.

      Most of us, most students in

      basic training can make a single

      talk of saying hey every month

      the baby started I may be 7

      pounds north of the 12 and such

      like that.

      And you can make a point and

      make another point and use your

      graph paper to grow your line

      and that your data and it's

      pretty easy able to represent

      easy to qualify or Sonification

      which also you later.

      If you want to measure the

      height and weight of a person

      you have three things you have

      to keep track of.

      Yes he is three dimensional

      graph to do that.

      The good news is you can't do

      this, humans can actually see in

      three dimensions it turns out.

      And so, it is a bit more

      complex.

      But you can make a graph where

      you use alternate dimensions

      height and width and depth, and

      you can find out where a given

      management will follow along all

      three of these axes and make a

      chart you come up with a cloud

      of colors. A little harder to

      interpret, you might need to be

      able to do things like rotate

      and spin around your plot to see

      what is really happening but you

      can't do it. And you can do it

      in on the web or virtual reality

      way are way to explore clouds.

      Okay so far, so good.

      But what if I have in a case of

      astronomy were years studying,

      now that you might have 27

      gimmick parameters you want to

      try and visualize at the same

      time it is not going to happen.

      Because, we cannot see and for

      the or beyond.

      If you can raise your hand I

      have questions for you.

      [Laughter]

      So, instead, if you want to

      stick to the visuals we are

      forced to do things like

      represent the different data

      sets with even more properties

      of the data points up trying to

      plot.

      So for example, I am signing

      another chart but at this time

      instead of just having black

      little circles where I make

      measurements now I have to do

      things like say okay I will use

      different shapes with different

      symbols to represent whether you

      are a teenager or middle-age man

      or another senior citizen.

      And then I will use a color to

      represent something like your

      temperature in your body over

      the sides of the shape to keep

      track of your blood oxygen

      level. It becomes a mess.

      In trying to represent this

      visual. Sound however is

      inherently multidimensional.

      You can change lots of

      properties of sound and we are

      all very equipped to be able to

      understand and synthesize those

      different sounds.

      I'm not saying you're be able to

      understand certification of

      complication but without

      training but anymore they

      finance the first greater house

      officer doing.

      But with training, and

      experience, things like changing

      pitch and tone and the type of

      content may, and audio, I can

      change whether this is coming

      from the left of the right of

      room up or from the floor back

      or forward.

      We've all been to movie theaters

      with good 3D surround sound

      systems right?

      You understand how this can be

      used to represent different

      parts of your data inherently.

      So sun can be used to understand

      and look for analysis of highly

      dimensional complex data.

      In the last one, the most

      important in many cases is its

      accessibility. If I show you

      charts they are not accessible

      if you cannot see the screen.

      But if I were to include sound

      without chart, and makes the

      data more accessible.

      And as you heard earlier there

      is no good reason why astronomy

      has been a visible science other

      than just historical bias.

      We have many, many decades or

      centuries beyond someone going

      out in Europe funded by some

      king or whatever, and taking the

      telescope and looking at the

      stars and saying that is bright.

      It's what is it?

      Give me a size, once the data we

      analyze is not an optical

      wavelength.

      And as you can see example

      looking at infrared.

      They absorb in the ultraviolet

      which is usually blocked by

      Earth atmosphere for good reason

      thankfully we do not get

      horrible cancer because of that.

      But it's a difficult to observe

      in the UV in this -- and many

      continued also.

      None of us can see survive

      because if you do I have

      questions for you if you can.

      So we can and should include

      other ways in interpreting

      nonhistorical ways of taking a

      picture and looking at it and

      trying to make measurement data.

      So that's the motivation for

      using sound in particular using

      sound with and combined with

      other devices like haptics and

      visuals.

      So I'm going to show some

      examples of some of the vacation

      days of the tools that we've

      created here called Astronify,

      and were going to start off not

      by using astronomy data at all,

      don't worry we'll get there, but

      it's important to ground

      ourselves in expectation. Some

      going to play for you a couple

      of Sonification that are based

      on sandwich pictures. To give

      you a sense of what the sample

      look like before we look at real

      data from stars.

      So, it's an open source Python

      package and it was a roughly

      year-long package for a team to

      work on are we now were working

      on down the side.

      It is open-source. It's on

      GitHub.

      In one of those is called pitch

      matching. Again, going back to

      the baby changing its weight

      over time if you make a graph on

      the graph paper with the sound

      software does is it takes its

      data .100 same and it turns your

      measurements 7 pounds.

      A 9 pounds.

      Her 12 pounds or into different

      size.

      they can imagine one way of

      doing this is by saying hey, as

      the value and measuring the

      gravy in this case goes up, I

      can choose to make this sound

      riser pitch. I can make a go

      route in pitch, Argie used

      different types of sounds, I can

      make is a lot of choices but

      that's an example.

      So what this software does is he

      looks at the measurement and

      makes the sound in the mix

      another one and another one.

      And it's all customizable, so

      you can change things like how

      long ceased on play for he as it

      goes from point-to-point and you

      can also change how fast it

      plays each data point as well as

      properties of what how much it's

      is valued to of sound.

      Making sense so far?

      All right let's and bosons here

      to regular Telstar capabilities.

      Before I go along, I do want to

      give a shout out to our team.

      Jen is a big shout out to her,

      Claire who is now studying her

      PhD in astronomy at St. Andrews

      in Scotland.

      They might be online but I'm not

      sure.

      Myself of course, an end Kate

      Meredith.

      And it couldn't be done without

      all of their hard work and

      dedication sellers and thank

      you.

      Okay, so we will start a firm

      with a simple example.

      I would play something like 24

      or so measurement in this data

      is boring because it doesn't do

      anything.

      It is the same value over and

      over and over again.

      They get a sense of what I mean

      of when I say is going to play

      one sound per data.

      So you see or hear something

      like twice -- and no play with a

      small overlap so it's a

      continuous sounding you should

      hear it okay let's give it a try

      and see how things go.

      [sound is playing]

    </p><p> The sound was more or less

      the same pitch it each point

      make sense?

      Now will make it more

      interesting certification.

      Here I have some values about 24

      again and there's some odd

      number of them and they're going

      to be changing from low to high

      and a constant study step.

      To this is basically at a

      diagonal line of data points if

      that makes sense.

      So, for they Sonification, I

      have chosen to make it as a

      value increases, the pitch goes

      up so if you hear a higher pitch

      that is a higher value.

      Let's see what that looks like a

      sounds like.

      [sound is escalating]

    </p><p> PresenterSounds like

      something's incoming right?

      But it makes sense.

      What the data is doing. In this

      site it steadily increased in

      value.

      And its usefulness is there.

      Next April's going to give you

      is the top of the triangle

      before a player, I want you want

      to think about what is the top

      of the triangle look like and

      imagine yourself with your eyes

      closed and feel in the top of

      the wooden block of a triangle

      and knowing what the previous

      example was, and what that

      sounded like a constant rise

      what you think the top of the

      triangle certification should

      sound like and that I will

      played in just the second and

      see if that matches what you

      might intuitively expect so here

      we go.

      Top of the triangle.

      [sound is playing]

    </p><p> Presenter: up-and-down

      document expected and constantly

      increasing in both direction.

      The last example I have is the

      top of the circle.

      And again, imagine the sleep of

      the top of the circle and what

      that feels like and what it's

      doing.

      And geometrically.

      And what the triangle sounded

      like and think about how you

      might expect the certification a

      set of data points that has that

      shape in the cracks on here we

      go with the last example [sound

      is playing in the shape of a

      circle]

    </p><p> Presenter: Anybody here a

      difference from the triangle on

      the circle?

      If I played your again and asked

      you without showing you I bet

      you most of you could guess

      which was a triangle which once

      a circle right.

      The circle sounded more gradual

      as it rise and that the middle

      of the circle like the ship

      itself the sound is not changing

      as much overtime.

      So that's the basics of

      Sonification using shapes.

      Okay, now that's going to space.

      Now I'm going to sew some

      Sonification a real data.

      The concept is the same.

      But I showed you before was a

      collection of data points that

      Jess had arbitrary values that

      make shapes like triangles and

      circles.

      But what I'm showing you NASA's

      actual data of brightness of

      stars as a function of time.

      This is called a light curve,

      something that a lot of

      astronomers do a lot of times

      going back to that European

      astronomers staying at stars in

      measuring how bright they are is

      a fundamental aspect of what to

      do strongly and understand

      objects in space.

      Usually what we do is make sure

      the brightness of an object and

      we can make a chart because

      again is only two things evolve

      here.

      Is the object and when you

      observed it.

      That's what I refer to as one

      dimensional data right?

      Going back to the example of the

      date baby and its weight over

      time.

      I need to make a mark on my

      graph paper and how bright the

      object is and when I observed it

      that day.

      There's only two parameters

      here.

      Normally, what we would do is

      make a chart.

      We may collect those lines and

      make a couple curves to study

      average stars are changing are

      not overtime. But here we want

      to satisfy commerce but what I'm

      saying is this plot is a chart

      of a real-life curve from a

      telescope call Kepler.

      I don't have the data points but

      they are there.

      You know you see in the line and

      it describes the shape.

      In this particular object starts

      off with some value in its fade

      quickly gets bright very

      sharply.

      And then gradually over time it

      becomes to fade and that there

      is the very end of this

      particular set of observations

      the star brightens just a little

      bit, little bump at the end and

      then he goes back down again.

      To that the description of the

      shape and going to play the

      actress on a vacation doing the

      same thing we did with the

      shapes but this time apply to

      real data.

      [sound is playing]

    </p><p> Presenter: Okay.

      So that's what a coupler like

      curve sounds like.

      Not literally, remember you not

      measuring sound but in most

      cases we are using this on to

      represent what the data point is

      feeling.

      If you're really careful I can

      played again, but at the very

      and see if you can actually

      detect a second bump towards the

      very end. So let's play this

      again for everyone.

      [sound is playing]

      There is a little wobble at the

      end of that little bump the

      Tennessee.

      So, that is real data.

      And it is really important

      because some of these missions

      like TES S which is flying right

      now and orbiting the work Mark

      it's staring at stars to help

      understand how they change and

      how things like things go over

      planets and the stars themselves

      and black hole is how all things

      change in brightness and one of

      the specifics behind it.

      So this is a very common data

      set that a lot of astronomers

      use and analyze.

      We've heard XO plans before,

      thanks to our public outreach

      friends they were able to

      explain what it is but it's

      simple. It's planets that are

      orbiting any planets that are

      not the son.

      So these are quite literally

      alien worlds.

      When I grew up in junior high

      school in 1995 when the first

      real Exoplanet opening a star

      like this done unlike the sun

      was announced.

      I wasn't 30 years ago and we

      still didn't have any real

      direct evidence of planets

      absorbing that -- now we are

      understanding what they're made

      out of gets there is thousands

      of them and were understanding

      the differences and ultimately

      try to search for the presence

      and frequency of them whether

      life was common or uncommon in

      them or whether a worker to

      find.

      So one of the ways you can try

      to find planets is to stare at

      her star for a long.

      Of time and measure very

      precisely how bright the store

      is.

      And if we wait patiently enough,

      we might be able to see when a

      planet orbiting a star happens

      to cross in front of another

      star in our line of sight.

      Much like solo walking front of

      a project in a movie theater.

      When they walk so what in the

      movie.

      You say down in front.

      In this case we really want to

      see that because by measuring

      how much light is blocked or how

      much it is blocked for and

      ultimately other properties, you

      can figure out how things the

      big the planet is and what is

      made out of and will begin

      analyze that light.

      In the shape it makes as it

      walks or as it orbits in front

      of the star is there a U-shaped

      dip.

      Or when it blocks different

      amounts of the stars face, and

      then goes through most of the

      star, and it's most of it is

      blocked and then at the end it

      orbits outside of the start.

      And then we have to wait for

      itself or orbits all the way

      around the star again and then

      it will cross again.

      But if we see these repeated

      crossings, that can tell us that

      there is a planet around a star.

      The earth takes 365 days to go

      around the sun once that is

      called a year here.

      I know this is brand-new

      information for all of you.

      But Ann Merkley, the closest

      planet to the sun orbits around

      the star and 88 days.

      That's how long it's years last.

      But somebody's planets all the

      way around it orbits the star in

      hours.

      That's how long the year is.

      It is unexpected when they first

      refined and then in very

      different solar systems.

      Other planets are so low that we

      haven't seen them come back

      again yet even though we live

      boot orbiting for a long.

      Of time. So there's lots of lots

      of different data.

      And this is how we try to look

      for.

      Now, you can make a plot or a

      chart of the stage brightness

      and makes a U-shaped like I

      said.

      You can also turn this into

      sound power with the help of

      your analysis and make it more

      accessible.

      So I'm showing on the slide

      right here is a plot of the

      brightness of a real star in

      zooming in where a little while

      the star is not doing much and

      then about in the halfway point

      of the plot, there is a sharp

      drop in the brightness of the

      star and the planet is crossing

      in front of it and blocking some

      of the stars light. And then it

      moves on its merry way in the

      stock goes back to its normal

      level of brightness.

      It is called a transit.

      So the data itself, looks like

      the letter you basically and

      there's a little bit of work was

      going on because the

      measurements are not perfect and

      the star itself is changing a

      little bit so looks like a

      wiggly rag really looking U. So

      I'm going to make the same

      Sonification and brightness as

      it decreases in brightness and

      couldn't make the sound drop.

      That is my choice I could choose

      other things but let's see how

      the sound like.

      [sound in the shape of E.U.]

    </p><p> Presenter: You she here

      pretty clearly the sound of the

      job.

      As I've mentioned, what we

      really want to do is look for

      repeated tips because that tells

      us for sure that something is

      orbiting.

      And the more you can watch it

      the better you can measure its

      properties.

      So here's another example of a

      light curve.

      This is about nine days worth of

      data and is from the space

      telescope.

      And they are three events.

      Three times that are planet

      orbiting the star block some of

      the light.

      So, what I'm plotting in this

      graph is sort of a more or less

      constant level of star

      brightness.

      There is a little bit of a

      graduate drop, but are three

      distinct times roughly different

      space there is a drop in

      brightness caused by a planet

      blocking the light. The same

      plan each time.

      The difference of how long it

      takes for us to come back again

      tells of how long the years. So

      in this case, the planet itself

      go the other way around the star

      in about four and a half days.

      Which is pretty short compared

      to the earth or Mercury, but not

      too uncommon for a lot of stars

      in our galaxy's.

      So let's listen to the

      Sonification and see if you can

      hear those three distinct dips.

      Here we go.

      [sound moving]

      So that's what we're using for

      Sonification, and in this

      example that anyone also here

      and it might be a little hard

      but the gradual overall?

      A decrease in the pitch?

      So on the graphic so if can sort

      of see why this is not exactly

      why it's perfectly flat.

      The star is gradually decreasing

      but for other physical reasons.

      It is interesting you can hear

      that.

      All right.

      So, who's ready for the

      interaction part.

      All the rain.

      So, you will be listening to

      three more examples of real data

      from real planets causing these

      dips.

      Your challenge, as you listen to

      the Sonification, is to count

      how many transits occur in each

      certification.

      And, I am not going to show you

      the graph the first time I play

      the sound in case anyone wants

      to train cheap.

      And then, after everyone has a

      chance to count I will show you

      the sound individual together so

      you can see how.

      Okay. And then if you want to

      online, feel free to find the

      chat if you want to put indexes

      in the chat please feel free

      through and here in the room to

      hold up your fingers or it

      showed her how many you think

      you are and feel free you don't

      have to you can always keep in

      your head.

      So here we go, first real trance

      curve right data.

      I'm sorry -- I wanted to remind

      you everyone that what we're

      expecting to hear, so this is

      the same when I show before, the

      light curve with three transit

      we will listen to a warmer time

      to make sure you all are

      grounded in what we expected and

      I show you.

      So here's one more baseline

      certification.

      [sound is moving]

    </p><p> That's an example case a new

      data here we go. I will play for

      each certification.

      Certification number one

      [Sonification]

      Let's hear it one more time.

      I have a bunch of hands up who

      have the writing two. I didn't

      do it on purpose, based on how

      many figures you have.

      But you are correct.

      There are in fact five distinct

      transits.

      Do we have numbers on the check?

      Nice.

      Yes, sometimes it's tricky we

      can be off by one, and cheated a

      little bit because normally

      would go ahead and listen to the

      public probably two or three

      times before you have a real --

      but he had a great job even

      though with just one.

      So we'll play it again, here's

      the actual plot of the data.

      It looks like many of the other

      ones where the star is hanging

      out was in brightness and

      there's five big tips on this

      planet.

      You will also notice for those

      of you looking at the plot that

      has led to the between each big

      dip is another small little did.

      The law hard to see what you

      might be able to see if it is

      much, much much smaller it's a

      hundred times less deep than the

      main goods.

      This is a real effect, this is

      actually the planet itself going

      behind the star and the

      telescope is so sensitive and

      not only finds out when the

      planet blocks the starlight but

      also can detect that hate you

      I'm missing something when the

      planet goes behind the sign that

      the actual planet itself not

      adding to the overall light what

      is behind the star.

      That's on the secondary.

      So if you're really, really

      careful you might be able to

      hear that second little did that

      happen halfway through between

      each bigger day.

      So let's play woman time here we

      go.

      [sound is playing]

      All right, those are the five

      tips.

      A gang year timing may vary

      depending on the quality of this

      beginning to room in your

      ability to interpret the noise,

      but if you had some practice I

      bet you could pick up that sound

a little bit more.

Okay, here's a more challenging

work. Your neck and be able to

use one hand for this one I'll

give you that much of a hand.

So keep the account going here

we go [sound is playing]

19? Anyone in the check us in

19?

Won you guys are good.

Indeed, there are I think 19

transits in this.

Again, the stars are hanging out

a notice that smaller dipping

between each one, that is also

real effect.

And they're actually making

tractors. If I told you this is

the same amount -- and I know I

tried to explain about how the

interval determines the orbit is

this one even closer or farther

away?

From the previous one? It's

closer.

Because it happens that many

more times.

So leaving that basic size tells

us that this orbital.

Of this planet is much, much

much shorter than the previous

one right?

So let's listen to this warmer

time to see the visuals and

begin make sure you double check

my map that I have 19 correctly.

[sound is playing]

All the rights.

So here's the last example will

move towards. Here's another

transits, and I will go ahead

and play it.

And while you're listening to it

on my plate twice.

And there is a unique little

thing that happens that happens

towards the very end and I see

you freaking crazy law what's

happening there.

So listen very carefully why

each countable year ago.

[sound is playing]

Shall I played again? All right

here we go I will play one more

time I lets do this.

[sound is playing]

Their first how many transits?

Three yes.

Frequent 3.

People online have not guessed

yet but spoilers.

Anybody here's something

interesting towards the very

end?

What you hear? A wobble?

</p><p> A high-pitched tone right at

the end.

</p><p> That's right there was a high

pitch you may have thought that

because of something wrong with

the system but no don't worry

fellas this is what the light

curve looks like.

There was wobbly going on this

is a real effect on the star

which is probably worth called a

star spot, which is a cool part

of the atmosphere they're

telling us how fast the star

itself is rotating in this part

of the store was darker than

other parts coming in and out of

view.

And we have a fine curve up and

down like wavy, then we have

these big dips because of planet

we don't care about, but at the

very, very, very end, there is a

spike. A really high-pitched

bike.

That was really high-pitched

arrogant almost like it was a

hearing test.

And, that is one of two things,

either at ports a calibration

era a mistake, or most likely

this is a flare.

This is something myself I study

additive study this this and

that.

And I'm a bit of a nerd when it

comes to what I would like to

study, but this flare is like an

event where the start itself

with magnetic show comes

together and it bursts.

And there's a lot of interesting

effects when that happens on the

star because both layers and

questions about whether the

planet is close to the stars

like they have been a lot. The

sun flares once in a while.

Some of you may have remembered

in the past when there's a big

flare sometimes it can cause

problems with IDBS for

electronics or causes the

increase in the Aurora because

of the medic field interaction,

and if it's really bad it can

cause blackouts which happens at

least once.

Thankfully the sun doesn't do

that too often.

But there are some starts with

different types that love to

flare.

And it causes a bit of a ruckus

and some of them have planets

around the movie of big

questions about what they might

look like and what they do. It's

really interesting end of the

graduated but our play woman

times but this time don't worry

about the planet just to listen

for the energy then here for the

end, listen for the really short

high-pitched deep which is that

flare.

Here we go.

[sound is playing]

And there is that P. That is

that flare.

And like I said, there is some

starts with players that beep

all the time.

They beeped and beeped and

beeped some very interesting

make sure of alien planets them

going around.

All right.

That is the end of our game

show.

If you had fun, if you want to

share this with your family and

friends we have some surveys

online here in SurveyMonkey.

And you can listen to more

examples and texture is and your

friends and colleagues use to

see how many flares and planets

you can find. And some of them

are much, much higher than what

I shared with you today.

I gave it an easy introduction.

A yard did pretty well.

There are some that are much

harder because the harder the

data is the heart of the

employees.

Caps and fun with that.

If you would like to learn more

about Estrada fighting to your

software, I get access to the

surveys you can find all of the

information on our home page.

And like I said, the links to

source close itself is available

we welcome contribution and

anyone who wants to grab a

branch just to work on it they

are examples of how to satisfy

your own data. Especially for

astronomers in the room.

I would love it if in the future

you give a pro give appropriate

visitation meaning they don't

show the plot of the spectrum

are your light fixture.

It will slowly grow I think in

our field.

To get used to that in a way of

doing it.

And also surprisingly you might

find out why your data is.

I said we love to hear how you

be able to use this in your

plans. In their final like I

said give them joy a net so

please get all that good

information at a stratified

thought read the docs that I

owe.

that is Astronify Dot read the

docs Dot I owe.

And if you Google search

Astronify nobody is still in her

name yet.

So you will probably find our --

she should OCO contact me at

anytime.

Thank you for your attention I

will happily answer any

questions.

[Applause]

</p><p> SCSU hands already I see a

few of them already.

</p><p> I'm just curious what the

instrument is and why that

sound? Also thank you.

</p><p> Presenter: Gray Christian,

that in itself is a great choice

we make it Sonification, are

software -- we chose to use tone

versus wire or will instruments

because we thought that would

focus the attention of what the

data is doing.

We also felt that we would avoid

biases because, music have a lot

of conscious and subconscious

cultural interpretations and

emotions.

an even basic things spike most

of us are used to Western music.

The fundamental differences

exist, we just use it.

So view used exec water

Lindsay -- there's a danger of

introducing unintended analysis.

But, there are other people who

are using more like instrumental

sound to represent data.

The jury is out, but best the

reason we chose these towns for

our version. Great question.

</p><p> Hello it is Josh.

I am just curious, how come when

we hear the dips do we continue

to hear the tone?

</p><p> Continue to hear?

</p><p> The tone itself doesn't stop,

I would expect the tone to drop

down to be a trough, but instead

will be here is that the tone

continues to those jobs but we

also hear the low frequencies

are just curious why that is?

Is that an artifact of your

certification? Was that the way

the grace that the is

visualized?

</p><p> Presenter: There is to

address your question.

first of many creation was

happening during the drop is a

combination of the stars

blocking but the stars

continuing to change.

Especially because of the

surface itself.

So there's an additional

wiggling happening that what

changes what you hear.

Nothing to be a concept flat

bottom in most cases.

But the other thing to note is

that there is some overlap in

each note.

And there is some intentional

overlap between previous notes

and the next note. And you're

probably hearing that because

the amount of times most of the

steps occur is very short

compared to the time it is not.

So you are probably hearing the

overlap and residuals of the

previous notes which were

adenoma brightness they heard

the dipping continued onward.

This a couple of reasons for

that, there's obviously a lot of

ways to customize it but one of

the reasons we did have overlap

us because we don't do that we

get clicking happening in the

sound when there is a gap

between the no.

We found that really

distracting.

Silly clothes for these

certifications to have that.

And there is a great question.

</p><p> All right, I hope this is in

the silly astronomy question --

what is the transit to?

What if the picks change?

saw the last one you showed, it

was slightly tired, and then the

next morning the next one?

</p><p> Great question.

Because the overall brightness

itself is changing. If there was

a -- if the style was admitting

1.00000 exactly amount of light

every time, the pitch was always

the same, you were here only to

exact science.

Full brightness and not so

brightness and then nothing.

But what is happening there is

two things.

Number one, the overall pattern

itself is not perfectly is

flatlined.

It is changing.

That could be two reasons.

Number one we didn't calibrate

the data perfectly and that

happens it's hard, but never too

many times the stars themselves

are changing for many reasons

and many timescales.

So, if I would have to guess,

most likely and I'm glad you

heard that because that's

interesting but most likely what

is happening is that the star

itself is over a long time is

over changing.

So you're seeing the steps on

top of the gradual overall

shape.

That's probably what's happening

is probably will physics.

</p><p> Thank you.

</p><p> You're welcome.

</p><p> Thank you.

This is Margaret.

So, are you using this to do

actual data analysis?

Do you listen to your data in

the car while jogging?

[Laughter]

That's a great question.

I, will the easy answer is I

don't have that time but I would

like to because I can, it is

important part of analysis and

requires training but I do try

to do that when I get back to

look at them like us.

So, my hope was that myself and

others will actually include

this in the other sort of

analysis.

What are the things that we did

is we actually went to the MIT

team the NAT running the test

mission and they have a bunch of

people who are part of the job

is to look at all these light

curves and tried to find out

which ones they have.

And they do it right now by

using a combination of a bunch

of measurements they made with

software and looking that up

bunch of times.

And they said hey let's include

silent, so we do a little demo

and got feedback.

It was really interested to

learn what part of the light

curves they care about and how

icky you sounds to amplify that.

But yes, my hope is that people

will do this.

I do have a plate as well to

make a test already at support

because they are literally

hundreds of billions of

measurements of stars of

different stars that have light

curves.

So I can make a radio station

that plays those sounds one

after the other and you would

not do anything to do anything

for years.

Because we have so much data. So

that can be fun.

That is a thing that can happen.

It's my dream.

</p><p> Have you done stereo

certification or broad-spectrum

noise was frequent re-structure

similar how human ears can hear

and sound in front of a listener

question my </p><p> That's a great

question we have not explored

that yet.

But there are teams who are

using stereos and

three-dimensional songs as part

of the certification in

particular images so all

certification tools is one big

national data.

Such rugs. There are teams who

are working on certification

images and they are there do

things they claim the left part

of the image and love featured

in the right part of the image

of the right speaker.

And that gives you a lot of good

sense of where you are and

that's a great question.

</p><p> We have time for one more

question. And I think I saw your

hand if for a while.

</p><p> Hello this is Shane. I am

just curious about scales of

things as in like timescales or

different tones will be a how

much experience dictation have

you done with that.

And thinking you can hear a

rhythm of something if it's a

short enough interval.

And if it's too long, you can be

like that is is that action an

interview? Or is it consistent

or not?

</p><p> There's a good question.

There's two factors there.

One is sort of the overall why

the vertical dimension of the

value how much is changing.

If I have a value who goes 14 oh

billion I have to make sure you

don't blow out your Ella Jones

when I make sounds.

Or I don't play pitch their

Louis Dorsey here which is not

good great I don't want to give

doxed PDFs -- but the code

itself is normalizing the data

but makes it a little

challenging if you trying to

direct comparisons between

things that you do want to play

like sequentially at their

changing our lives and their

absence dementia. And that's

after they try to figure out how

to do well.

Here the problem we have his

time.

I play relatively short clips

but some of these measurements

have thousands of data points

even if I may each data point

last half a second were

listening to like a minute or

longer sound than anything to

forget when you heard it

earlier.

So were trying to come out with

in the latest version will be

called tips, but just like hey

here's a big pot that has 10,000

data points and I don't want to

listen to a five minute tone

that sounds horrible right?

But I do when I get a sense of

what they're doing so were

trying to break it up into

pieces and play short 52nd

overall sound that represents

the data to help.

You could always speak of these

things so fast without the

detail.

So these are all great questions

and similar challenges when it

comes to making this that

doesn't just sound scope of

represents that data.

I think Dan is good.

</p><p> Thank you Scott and think

info for your questions.
